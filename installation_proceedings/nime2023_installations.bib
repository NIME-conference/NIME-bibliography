  abstract = {The Tremolo-Chimes is an interactive performance system that consists of a set of tubular metallic wind chimes that have been modified by removing the striker and wind catcher. MIDI-controlled vibration motors suspended in each chime produce continuous, tremolo-like sounds where the dynamic shape can be controlled over time. This system is inspired by acoustic wind chimes and explores questions about performative agency in automated instruments. The Tremolo-Chimes interactive installation employs multiple control methods, including synthesized wind and sensors that detect the proximity of participants to the chimes. Both synthesized wind and sensor input are fed through a mass-link physical model, evoking the movements of a wind-driven clapper bouncing off traditional wind chimes. Synthesized wind represents the default control mode of the installation when participants are not interacting with the sensors. When a participant enters the sensing field, their body will actuate the chimes similarly to how a percussionist uses their hand to sweep across a set of chimes.}

  abstract = {Bug demonstrates the potential of sound event recognition (SER) in locating insect-like noises or socially undesirable elements by navigating through spatial audio (Ambisonics) field recordings. It is a commentary on the increasing development of audio technologies with uses in entertainment and advertising, as well as in surveillance, law enforcement and the military.<br/>In bug, an algorithm scans through spatial audio captured at urban environments in Hong Kong. Field recordings of Cantonese dialects, South-East Asian languages, Asian music and wildlife are analysed, pursuing insect-like sounds. They are then made audible by parametric speakers emitting modulated ultrasound with a laser pointing in the same direction using a pan-tilt base and servo motors. The emitted ultrasound is highly directional, creating a “beam” of inaudible sound waves more similar to light than conventional audio. As the waves collide with the interior of the installation space and demodulated, audible sound emanates from the point on the wall, ceiling or floor at which they are reflected.}

  abstract = {“near and far” is an interactive sound and light installation that explores how proximity influences our perception of sound in space and our relationships with people, places, and things. The installation aims to provide co-creative agency to the audience, whose presence and actions uniquely define the experience of the work. Movement is sonified in the space via a distance sensor and audience members may turn on and off a collection of three lights to toggle between soundscapes and musical compositions. The soundscapes and compositions range from abstract electronic sounds, to fully-fledged song / composition arrangements, to everyday sounds like wind, waves, and urban transit. The multiplicity of sonic spaces was inspired by the author’s belief that embodying plurality is a core facet of being human and, when enacted in art, provides many varied opportunities for observers to resonate emotionally or otherwise engage.}

  abstract = {Imagine entering a room with dimmed lights and moving around without knowing how to control the acoustic feedback loops. You may need to bend your body or contract yourself to tame the loops that can escalate very quickly. The system details are presented in a related paper submission for this year’s NIME, entitled ``Music--Dance with Acoustic Feedback: An Exploratory Study on Embodiment and Agency.'' Briefly, participants of this interactive installation step into a room alone, knowing they can create acoustic feedback loops by changing their proximity between the lavalier microphone mounted on their head and the loudspeakers asymmetrically placed in a reverberant room. They are given two Myo sensor bands that capture each forearm's muscle activity and orientation, with which they can control the sound parameters of the feedback loops. In addition, muscle contractions \&amp; relaxations of the participants are also mapped to color parameters projected in the room as the primary light source. The visuals essentially comprise solid colors aimed at providing the participant with a more immersive experience with respect to their covert bodily processes.}

The project uses a sonic cyberfeminist lens to critically explore aesthetic and relational hierarchies at the intersection of sound, gender and technology.}

  abstract = {"Song of Distances" is a participatory and algorithmic composition based on ubiquitous computing. It praises the concept of compressed time/space and connectivity. Each login session is represented as a node in the topographic coordinate by granting access to GPS data by the user. The system calculates the session period and relative distances between the center and each node to generate m. At the same time, the orientation affects the spatiality of the sound, transforming the positioning data into audible events. Each networked entity that contributes data to the system is the center point of its coordinate and a detective node on other devices. The user can close the webpage or keep it open while moving; all of the behavior and decisions reflect on the parameters of the generative music. Thus, this piece gradually evolves with crowd participation as a collective experience on the Internet.}

  abstract = {This work is a sound installation using dome architecture and a large woofer 80 cm in diameter. The "sacrifice" is made by having one person lie on top of the woofer and surrounding it for viewing. The audience is enveloped in the story by viewing a lone person lying on top of a large speaker, as if offering a sacrifice in a ritualistic way, thereby drawing the audience members into the narrative. In addition, the very large bass, consisting of woofers, gives a sense of presence and eeriness. The sound flowing from here is based on the traditional folk tales of "Bon-Bon Shark" that remains in the Japanese town of Manazuru and composed as a Soundscape composition. The story is about a couple sharks who are killed by a bell dropped from a boat by a sailor, and sacrifices are made to these sharks.}

  abstract = {LOOP is an interactive sound object made from green polyester strapping tape. The sound that arises from the interaction with the object is picked up by a contact microphone and amplified. Due to the material qualities of the polyester tape which allows sound to travel through the tape (approx. 100 meters) it is possible to sense the acoustic interaction through one single piezo-microphone. The sound is composed of a low rumble that derives from the length of the tape. Combined with some higher pitched and rich blended interaction sounds from scratching and hitting the LOOP. The object combines haptic, tactile, visual and acoustic qualities. It can be touched, squeezed and ”played”by the audience. LOOP was created within the Textile and Sound research project by Gertrud Fischbacher and Marius Schebella.}

An interactive mirror than can be, not only seen, but heard and felt is created. During this act of techno-shamanism, the public will also control their brain activity at will by trying to repeat a gesture made by the self-portrait of fire.}

The machine will see the world only based on this audio-visual relationship, and the audience can see themselves through the machine-generated images and sounds. YouTube Mirror is an artistic attempt to simulate my unconscious, implicit understanding of audio-visual relationships that can be found in and limited by the videos I watched. YouTube Mirror also attempts to represent the possibility of the machine's bias caused by implicit bias inherent in video recommendation algorithms as well as a small set of personal data.}

Diverse old and obsolete media and technologies, collected through the local reuse stores, such as vinyl records, computer fans, disco-ball and old books, are attached to the sculptures, and these attached components move and light up by interacting with the user’s behaviors. Our goal of presenting this installation to the NIME community is to explain and show how we can design creative computational artifacts through more improvisational, event-based, and frugal ways.}
