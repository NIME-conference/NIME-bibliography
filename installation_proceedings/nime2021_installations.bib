 abstract = {The representations that real-time, always-on, data-driven technologies will enhance society like never before promotes an historical inattention that ignores the entangled genealogy of contemporary social media. Within a media archaeological context, this work presents Twitter and the telegraph as related forms of social media. Click::TWEET, a sound installation utilising obsolete media technology, is presented as an audio-visual representation of a genealogy of connections between past media technologies and contemporary social media. Click::TWEET can be considered a return to the material representation of media through the physical re-presentation of Twitter messages transported as invisible digital media through the physical materiality of the telegraph key. By enabling the ability to hear the present through the past, Click::TWEET reconfigures the existence of the telegraph within a broader history of social media.},

What happens when the text of A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates is ‘vocalized’ by an electro-mechanical object? Using a media archaeological research approach, Click::RAND#2, an indeterminate sound sculpture utilising relays as sound objects, is an audio-visual reinterpretation and representation of an historical relationship between a book of random digits and the electromechanical relay. Developed by the first author, Click::RAND#2 is the physical re-presentation of random digit data sets as compositional elements to complement the physical presence of the work through spatialized sound patterns framed within the context of Henri Lefebvre’s rhythmanalysis and experienced as synchronous, syncopated or discordant rhythms.},

Using hand-tracking technology, visitors of this virtual reality (VR) sound installation can play a virtual keyboard instrument displayed via a head-mounted display. Following an experimental approach to contemporary piano music, in this installation the entire instrument behaves differently compared to the real world. Due to the virtual-physical system, the expected quickly transforms into the unexpected. The implications of an instrument with free-floating keys that produce sound when they collide are to be explored by the visitors.},

The Architectural Sonificafion Project is an ongoing effort to give voice to automated systems and our interaction with them in the world. When these sub-currents and activities are brought to life as an auditory experience, their greater depth and complexity become more fully apparent. Though the project has a strong data component, the aspect of play is purely physical, personal, and sensitive to choice. A vent which appears to only blow out air has in fact a myriad of every variable vortices, velocities, and gradients. It is hoped that this effort can bridge a general awareness for all of us to slow down and look beneath the surface we unconsciously apply to our daily lives.},

 abstract = {We study the question of how wireless, self-contained CMOS-synthesizers with built-in speakers can be used to achieve low-threshold operability of multichannel sound fields. We deliberately use low-tech and DIY approaches to build simple sound modules for music interaction and education in order to ensure accessibility of the technology. The modules are operated by wireless power transfer (WPT). A multichannel sound field can be easily generated and modulated by placing several sound objects in proximity to the induction coils. Alterations in sound are caused by repositioning, moving or grouping the sound modules. Although not physically linked to each other, the objects start interacting electro-acoustically when they share the same magnetic field. Because they are equipped with electronic sound generators and transducers, the sound modules can work independently from a sound studio situation.},

Each agent tells a story which is heard from a distance as an unintelligible choir of fragmented stories and distorted voices. As the viewer approaches an agent, the story becomes sonically clearer and semantically more coherent. When in the agent’s immediate personal space, the viewer can hear the first-hand account of a sexual assault survivor.

The roads resemble how our vein lines are interconnected and how the blood circulates in our bodies in various directions, at various speeds, and in different conditions. This new artwork explores the line segmentation and the structure of veins and compares them to roads in the real world. This artwork includes biometric data sonification on top of 3D map-based visualization and 3D printed sculptures. The vein lines are transformed to sound, and the participants can listen to their unique “audio signature” generated by their veins. By using various visual features extracted by image processing techniques, the branches, length of lines, size of veins, brightness, and contrast of images determine parameters of audio synthesis and create a unique and personalized sound for each participant.},

By lighting a candle, a participant can trigger a sound that gradually changes along with candle burning – a change in the length of the candle. With seven candles on the installation table lit, each candle triggers a unique sound at a unique timing with the use of infrared sensors; as a result, they together create weaving sound streams at the site. The musical composition will always be unique due to varying combinations of sounds based on numbers, timings, and lengths of the candles that participants light. The movements of candle flames create subtle fluctuations in sound. Slow and introspective time flows in the space, and participants and witnesses are encouraged to immerse themselves in the environment. The lights, sounds, warmth, smell, and texture of the candles will speak to the participants’ senses.},
