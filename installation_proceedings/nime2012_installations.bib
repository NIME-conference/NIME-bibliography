Whisker Organ is an interactive sound instrument linking the voices of a 30-person chorus with 48 black cat whiskers. Through touch, visitors to the piece activate the sound of massed voices singing, creating spontaneous, infinitely-variable musical compositions. Whisker Organ is built on a system of  piezoelectric sensors connected to a series of microprocessors, which in turn control sound output to an external speaker system. The sonic experience is oversized, unexpected, and richly human. The tactile experience is mysterious, perhaps evoking a frisson of discomfort, but also inescapably compelling. Whisker Organ both requires and enables the leap of imagination necessary to make sense of the joining of two organic but otherwise unconnected references. Whisker Organ was created in collaboration with the Oriana Consort who performed the vocal notes for the instrument. The music that forms the basis of Whisker Organ's sound output was composed in 2011 by Walter Chapin.

``Aura: Presence/without$^*$ Manual'' is a soundsculpture which functions as a transducer converting motion into sound in the form of a pendulum. The loudspeaker becomes the interactive means through which movement can become sound. Its internal functions corresponds to the behaviour of the human element. The live-object is built to react to its human counterpart in order to achieve the lightness of a sound-element in flux.
With the hand as a source, the visual aspect of the object`s motion and the acoustic are combined with the movement and result in creating acoustic and visual correspondences. These correpondences enable the comprehension of a system which is created by the interaction itself, a game of balance which can keep us immersed in a minimum amount of information.

Cryoacoustic Orb is a sound installation involving multiple illuminated acrylic orbs filled with slowly melting ice. Hydrophones frozen inside the ice amplify the sounds of the melting process, which are electronically processed and spatialized throughout the darkened gallery space. The result is a unique ambient soundscape that evolves over the course of several hours.

Halfway between instrument and sculpture, Strings is a sound installation that invites participants to play, hear and move within a space, becoming part of a musical instrument. Strands of thread are tensed in oblique planes---from ceiling to floor, from wall to wall---, defining an architectural space that invites visitors in. Once inside, they become performers, moving through the space to find different ranges of pitch and timbres in the instrument that surrounds them. The sounds are generated synthetically but, as is the case with traditional acoustic instruments, the experience includes texture, space, color and movement.

Artist(s) Biography:

Luisa Pereira Hors holds a degree in Systems Engineering from Universidad ORT Uruguay. Combining her background as a developer, interaction designer and musician, her work uses technology to explore the ground between composition (non-interactive) and musical instrument (fully interactive).

Mutatis Mutandis is a multi-sensory installation that uses glaciological data to control an audio and visual environment. This data is interpreted in several ways including using the data to control parameters of sound files containing actual recorded glaciers (calving, ice-cracking, melting, sheet friction, etc.) and processing the data to synthesize sound and visualizations. The glacial sounds were collected from researchers and acousticians across the world, much of it field recorded in Antarctica. These audio-processes are distributed to several speakers located around the space.

Because glaciological change can take place over extremely long durations of time, this installation exposes various characteristics of glaciological history by accelerating their rates of change. To symbolize the real-time aspect of glaciological change, a large ice block is placed in the middle of the space, slowly melting throughout the installation's duration.

This project uses data taken from all over the world including WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), CrESIS (Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets) and the US census bureau.
