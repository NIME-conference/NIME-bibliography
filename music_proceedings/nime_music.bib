Lo specchio confuso dall’ombra can be translated as “The mirror confused by its shadow” and it is between a distributed installation and a concert, in which opposing groups of performers in two remote places play solo or interact.
The audience (two people at a time, one for each installation) activates video and sound transformations, depending on the space they occupy and their gesture. The two installation are in the Foyer and in the Auditorium, respectively, so the two persons from the audience cannot see and talk each other. Multimodal data and expressive gesture cues are extracted in real- time by an EyesWeb patch, interacting and playing with the electronic performer. The interaction occurs both between the electronic performer and the two places where the audience has access, and between the two remote installations. There are two different levels of intervention in the audio and video transformation: autonomous, depending on the single person and conditioned, depending on the behaviour and the actions occurring in the other, separate installation.
Further, the entrance of the concert hall has microphones, which capture words, sentences, coughs, laughs or other noise, which are transformed in real-time and thus entering into the piece.
Lo specchio confuso dall’ombra can’t bind the audience remain seated or follow a specific pattern in his behaviour. His duration is indefinite: it changes every time it is performed.

About the performers:
Roberto Girolin (1975) was born in Pordenone, Italy, and after studying of the classical guitar he began to study the piano and composition at the "J. Tomadini" Conservatory in Udine. He studied the vocal and instrumental counterpoint, graduating in choral music and conducting in the same Conservatory. He has conducted many choirs and orchestras, exploring different kinds of repertories from Gregorian music to contemporary music.
He has deepened the study of contemporary music at the University of Udine with Dr.A.Orcalli and then with Dr.N.Venzina at "B.Maderna" Archive in Bologna (Italy). He has followed several Masterclasses and seminars: choral music, chamber music, composition (Salvatore Sciarrino, Fabio Nieder, Mauro Bonifacio), electronic music (Lelio Camilleri, Agostino Di Scipio), a Sound Design course with Trevor Wishart, an Audio Digital Signal Processing for Musical Applications (Lab workshop, lessons and applications) with Giuseppe Di Giugno and live electronics in Luigi Nono's works with Alvise Vidolin and André Richard (Experimental Studio Freiburg für Akustische Kunst).
He graduated with full marks in Electronic Music and Multimedia at the Musical Academy of Pescara (Italy) and in 2006 he also got his degree at the Conservatory of Venice under the direction of Alvise Vidolin with full marks (cum Laude).
He is actively involved in performing and investigating the compositional and performance potential offered by electronic&multimedia music systems. His music is performed in Italy and abroad. He has recently won the “Call 2007”, (Italian CEMAT Competition) and a Mention at the 34th "Concours Internationaux de Musique et d'Art Sonore Electroacoustiques de Bourges", France.

Based on the installation "Mappe per Affetti Erranti", designed and developed by Antonio Camurri, Corrado Canepa, Nicola Ferrari, Gualtiero Volpe texts from Edmund Spenser’s The Faire Queen and William Shakespeare’s King Lear with support of EU ICT Project SAME.
The bow is a theatrical mise-en-scene of the installation Mappe per Affetti Erranti. During the Science Festival 2007, as a preparatory work for the EU ICT Project SAME on active listening (www.sameproject.org), the audience was invited to explore and experience a song by John Dowland (see the paper on these proceedings by Camurri et al). The audience could walk inside the polyphonic texture, listen to the singles parts, change the expressive quality of musical interpretation by their movement on the stage of Casa Paganini analysed with EyesWeb XMI. Aesthetically, the most interesting result consists in the game of hiding and revealing a known piece. The idea could be matched with the classical theatrical topos of recognition. So, the musical potentiality of the ‘interactive performance’ of a prerecorded music becomes a new dramaturgical structure.
Roberto Tiranti and his madrigalistic group recorded, under the supervision of Marco Canepa, different anamorphic interpretations of a bachian choral. Thanks to the interactive application developed with EyesWeb XMI, the group of dancers conducted by the choreographer Giovanni Di Cicco, mix and mould the recorded music material in real time. At the same time, the live sound of the vocal group explores the whole space of Casa Paganini, as a global (both real and imaginary) musical instrument. In a metamorphic game where, according to Corrado Canepa’s compositive lesson, electronic and acoustic technologies merge and interchange their specificity, this interactive score of losing and finding, multiplying and distillating the ancient bachian palimpsest tries to tell the dramatic history of King Lear, the most tragic western figure of difficulty to reach the affects you possess without being able to know or express.

About the performers:
Nicola Ferrari was born in 1973. He studied composition with Adriano Guarnieri and took his degree at ‘G. B. Martini’ Conservatory in Bologna. He took his Master Degree and PhD from the Faculty of Arts and Philosophy at University of Genoa. Since 2005 he is a member of the staff of the InfoMus Lab. For many years he directed the ‘S.Anna’ polyphonic choir. He wrote scores for theatrical performances.

Putting a distance sensor under the scroll of the instrument and an inclination sensor on the wrist, the detection of the displacements of the limbs of the interpreter becomes possible. These displacements, drawn onto a cartesian plane, give the coordinates of a track in an ideal performing space, whose third dimension is increased and formed by the passing of time. Actually, the computer permits to assimilate to the aforesaid track the sounding path proposed by the interpreter, hence to rehear it. Also in the latter case, the coordinates to access it are given by current gestures, therefore the dimension of time results bundled, somehow like considering a parchment palimpsest: the sounding form returned by the computer results increasingly dense and inexplicable and needs an electroacoustic exegesis that unleash it at least in shreds.
The procedures of musical production are here a metaphor for knowledge; alike are the compositional methods at the root of the score, which providing the prescriptions of the musical path, portrays in addition a mental track.

Aurora Polare (Polar Dawn) is a short piece for cymbals, tam-tam, vibraphone, live electronics and EyesWeb system. This piece was inspired by the smooth movements of waves, the drawings created by polar dawns and the cold weather in polar seas – that’s the reason why only metallophones are used.
The first matter to fight with was making the percussionist elaborate the sound they produce while playing their instruments and crafting a brand-new easy way to specify every movement. That’s why, under the traditional notation score, two special lines follow the music specifying the direction to move to: up-down and left-right/near-far. A line approaching the top or the bottom of the Y axis tells the way to track. You can find an example here on the left.
All of those movements fully interact with EyesWeb and MAX MSP thru two 30fps accelerometer bracelets worn by the performers. Every vertical movement controls the volume of the processed sound, while horizontal movements manage a different patch in MAX MSP suited to every instrument: a tam-tam sample speed controller (this make the instrument play without being touched), an harmonizer to make cymbals sing just like a Theremin, but with their own processed sound, and
the rate of a delay. In the control room a MIDI controller and a computer will be used to manage live additional effects and parameters, like granular synthesis, reverb and multi-slider filters.
Thanks to Martino Sarolli for helping me with MAX MSP, to Matteo Rabolini and Matteo Bonanni for playing my composition.

About the performer:
Alessandro Sartini: Born in Genoa in 1982, he studied piano with Canzio Bucciarelli and attends the last year of Composition at the Conservatory of Genoa with Riccardo Dapelo, who introduced him to “live electronic” treatments. His first public exhibition was at the Auditorium Montale of the Carlo Felice Theatre in Genoa, during the concert commemorating the 50th anniversary of Béla Bartók's death in 1995. From that year on he established a great number of collaboration with various solo musicians, who really appreciated his way to accompany; this guided him to work in partnership with a good number of professional soloists. In 1999 he joined the class of Composition at the Conservatory of Genoa with Luigi Giachino, who introduced him to film music: this interest led him to win the third prize at the Lavagnino International Film Music Festival in Gavi in 2006 and the first prize at the “Concorso Internazionale di Composizione di Alice Belcolle" in 2007. With Valentina Abrami, he is the founder of the “Associazione Musica in Movimento”, which operates at the “International School in Genoa”.},

The composition of Pyrogenesis took inspiration from several aspects of the blacksmithing, not in a literal way, but much as a set of correspondences :
First, the gesture, by which the blacksmith models the matter continuously; striking, heating, twisting, soaking metals to gradually print a form into them.
Then, the tool: Just like the blacksmith manufactures his own tools, I work on developing my own electro-acoustic instrument: an instrument to write sound, in space and with a gestural input.
Lastly, the organic construction of the form: Gilles Deleuze says "Why is the blacksmith a musician? It is not simply because the forging mill makes noise, it is because the music and the metallurgy are haunted by the same problem: that the metallurgy puts the matter in the state of continuous variation just as the music is haunted by putting the sound in a state of continuous variation and to found in the sound world a continuous development of the form and a continuous variation of the matter".
On a more technical/scientific point of view, the interaction with the performer uses two interfaces : a Wacom tablet, and a set of force- resistive-sensors (through an analog-to-digital converter), which common point is that they both allow control by the pressure of hands, and thus offer a very “physical” mode of control.
The composition/performance environment consists of a set of generative audio modules, fully addressable and presettable, including a mapping engine allowing a quick yet powerful set of mapping strategies from controllers inputs and volume envelopes to any parameter, including those of the mappers themselves, allowing a very precise, flexible, and evolutive sound/gesture relationship in time.
The composition has been realized through a constant dialogue between improvisations in a pre-determined trajectory, and afterwards- listening of the produced result. Thus, most of the details of the composition have been generated by an improvisation/learning-through- repetition process, without any visual support - thus allowing to emphasize expressivity while keeping a very direct relationship to the musical gesture.

About the performer:
Pascal Baltazar is a composer and research coordinator at GMEA, National Center for Musical Creation in Albi, France. His research focuses on spatial and temporal perception of sound, and its relationship to the body and musical gesture. He is coordinating the Virage research platform, on control and scripting novel interfaces for artistic creation and entertainment industries, granted by the French Research Agency, in the frame of its Audiovisual and Multimedia program, for the 2008-2009 period. He is an active member of the Jamoma collective.
He has studied Aesthetics (Masters of Philosophy Thesis The sonic image : material and sensation, 2001, Toulouse III, France) and electroacoustic composition at the National Conservatoire of Toulouse. He has then been implied as a composer or interactive designer in diverse artistic projects : concerts, performing arts shows and interactive installations. He has been commissioned for musical works by several institutions, as the French State, INA-GRM, GMEA, IMEB... and participated in international festivals (Présences Électroniques, Paris / Radio France Festival, Montpellier / Synthèse, Bourges / Videomedeja, Novi Sad / Space + Place, Berlin...).},

"Keo" is a performance for voice improvisation, Qgo sensor instrument, and live electronics. The author attempts to realize three concepts in the work. The first is "dual-layered control," in which the performer improvises phrases by singing and providing sound materials for a computer. Simultaneously, he sends commands to the
computer to process vocals using a pair of sensor devices worn on both hands. between the visuality of the performance and the musical
gestures. In most parts of the performance, the movement of the sensor instrument and the musical parameters are clearly connected. If the performer moves his hand even slightly, particular aspects of the sound are influenced in an obvious manner. The third is the strong connection between music and theatricality. In several parts of this work, the body motions of the performer not only control the sensor device, but also provide some theatrical meanings.

About the performer:
Chikashi Miyama received his BA(2002) and MA(2004) from the Sonology Department, Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo, Japan and Nachdiplom(2007) from Elektronisches studio, Musik-Akademie der Stadt Basel, Basel, Switzerland.

Intersecting Lines is a collaboration between clarinetist François Houle, interactive video artist Aleksandra Dulic and computer music composer Keith Hamel. The work grew out of Dulic's research in visual music and involves mapping a live clarinet improvisation onto both the visual and audio realms. In this work an intelligent system for visualization and signification is used to develop and expand the musical material played by the clarinet. This system monitors and interprets various nuances of the musical performance. The clarinetist’s improvisations, musical intentions, meanings and feelings are enhanced and extended, both visually and aurally, by the computer system, so that the various textures and gestured played by the performer have corresponding visuals and computer-generated sounds. The melodic line, as played by the clarinet, is used as the main compositional strategy for visualization. Since the control input is based on a classical instrument, the strategy is based on calligraphic line drawing using artistic rendering: the computer-generated line is drawn in 3D space and rendered using expressive painterly and ink drawing styles. The appearance of animated lines and textures portray a new artistic expression that transforms a musical gesture onto a visual plane. Kenneth Newby made contributions to the development of the animation software. This project was made possible with generous support of Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.

About the performers:
François Houle has established himself as one of Canada’s finest musicians. His performances and recordings transcend the stylistic borders associated with his instrument in all of the diverse musical spheres he embraces: classical, jazz, new music, improvised music, and world music. As an improviser, he has developed a unique language, virtuosic and rich with sonic embellishments and technical extensions. As a soloist and chamber musician, he has actively expanded the clarinet’s repertoire by commissioning some of today’s leading Canadian and international composers and premieringover one hundred new works. An alumnus of McGill University and Yale University, François has been an artist-in-residence at the Banff Centre for the Arts and the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Umbria, Italy. Now based in Vancouver, François is a leader in the city’s music community and is considered by many to be Canada’s leading exponent of the clarinet.

Keith Hamel is a Professor in the School of Music, an Associate Researcher at the Institute for Computing, Information and Cognitive Systems (ICICS), a Researcher at the Media and Graphics Interdisciplinary Centre (MAGIC) and Director of the Computer Music Studio at the University of British Columbia. Keith Hamel has written both acoustic and electroacoustic music and his works have been performed by many of the finest soloists and ensembles both in Canada and abroad.

VISTAS(2005) - Choreography with video, one musician playng live electronics and two dancers with metainstruments interacting with the music. Divided in three scenes the work is conceptually based in the “self-other” cognitive phenomena inspired by Edgar Morin's idea of the evolution of society through interdisciplinary interaction. The interdisciplinary feature of the piece is carefully constructed using 2 metainstruments that link the formal elements in a structural way. This metainstruments are two wireless microphones plugged into two stethoscopes attached to the dancers hands. The movements of the dancers make the microphones generate an amplitude that is transmitted to the computer and mapped into different music elements. Some live voice participations from the dancers add dramatic accents to the piece. Vistas is en integral piece in wich the music supports the choreography as well as the choreography gets influenced by the music. The video supports the scene creating an abstract space that changes and evolves according to the performance. The musical aesthetic has Noise elements and voice sample manipulation playing with texture and density contrast in a very dynamic way. The language of the choreography comes from an exploration of the planes in a 3rd dimension space by separate first and united later. The language is also influenced by the need to achieve the best usage as possible of the metainstrument.

The Pencil Project is a performance piece created by sound artists Martin Messier and Jacques Poulin-Denis. Their intention was to craft a live electronic music piece inspired by the physicality of writing and the imagery it articulates. The performers translate scribbling, scratching, dotting and drawing with pencil music. The computers are hidden and untouched throughout the piece, allowing object manipulation and the creation of sound to be the performers’ main focus.
The Pencil Project is about musicianship. Liberated from the computer screen and equipped with hands-on objects, the performers explore a new form of expressivity. Through an authentic and stimulating performance, the musicians bring computer music intimately close to playing an actual musical instrument.

About the performers:
Martin Messier: Holding a diploma in drums for jazz interpretation, Martin Messier has completed a bachelor’s degree in electroacoustic composition at the University of Montreal, and De Montfort University in England. Recently, Martin has founded a solo project called « et si l’aurore disait oui... », through which he develops live electroacoustic performance borrowing stylistic elements from Intelligent Dance Music, acousmatic and folk. Based on strong aptitudes for rhythm, Martin’s esthetic can be defined as a complex, left field and happily strange sound amalgam, constantly playing with construction and deconstruction.

Jacques Poulin-Denis is active in projects that intersect theater, dance and music. He has completed his undergraduate studies in electroacoustic composition from the University of Montreal, and De Montfort University in England. Most of his music was composed for theater and dance. Jacques explores innovative ways of presenting electro-acoustic music. Jacques’ musical style is evocative and filled with imagery. Combining traditional and electronic instruments with anecdotic sound sources of everyday life, he creates vibrant music that is fierce and poetic.},

Bent Leather Band introduces their new extended instrument project, Heretics Brew. The aim of this project is to develop an extended line up with the aim of building a larger ensemble. So far the project [quintet] has developed a number of new extended saxophone controllers and is currently working on trumpets and guitars. Their instruments are based on Gluion OSC, interfaces; programmable frame gate array devices that have multiple configurable inputs and outputs. For NIME08, the ensemble trio will demonstrate their instruments, language and techniques through ensemble improvisation.

About the performers:
Joanne Cannon, composer/improviser,  is one of Australia’s leading bassoonists. Although she began her career as a professional orchestral musician, she now works as a composer and improviser, exploring extended techniques. Stuart Favilla has a background in composition and improvisation. Together they form the Bent Leather Band, a duo that has been developing experimental electronic instruments for over twenty years in Australia. Bent Leather Band blurs virtuosity and group improvisation across a visual spectacle of stunning original instruments. These were made in conjunction with Tasmanian leather artist, Garry Greenwood. The instruments include fanciful dragon headed Light-Harps, leather Serpents and Monsters that embody sensor interfaces, synthesis and signal processing technology. Practicable and intuitive instruments, they have been built with multi-parameter control in mind. Joint winners of the Karl Szucka Preis, their work of Bent Leather has gained selection at Bourges and won the IAWM New Genre Prize.
Inspired by the legacy of Percy Grainger’s Free music, i.e. “music beyond the constraints of conventional pitch and rhythm” [Grainger, 1951], Bent Leather Band has strived to develop a new musical language that exploits the potentials of synthesis/signal processing, defining new expressive boundaries and dimensions and yet also connecting with a heritage of Grainger’s musical discourse. Grainger conceived his music towards the end of the 19th Century, and spent in excess of fifty years bringing his ideas to fruition through composition for theremin ensemble, the development of 6th tone instruments [pianos and klaviers], the development of polyphonic reed instruments for portamento control and a series of paper roll, score driven electronic oscillator instruments.

Tony Hicks enjoys a high profile reputation as Australia's most versatile woodwind artist. Equally adept on saxophones, flutes and clarinets, his abilities span a broad spectrum of music genres. A student of Dr. Peter Clinch, Tony also studied at the Eastman School of Music. He has performed throughout Australia, and across Europe, the United States, Japan and China with a number of leading Australian ensembles including the Australian Art Orchestra, Elision, and the Peter Clinch Saxophone Quartet. He has performed saxophone concertos with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, and solo’d for Stevie Wonder and his band. As a jazz artist he has performed and recorded with leading jazz figures Randy Brecker, Billy Cobham, notable Australian artists, Paul Grabowsky, Joe Chindamo, David Jones, and also lead a number of important groups in the local Australian scene. An explorer of improvised music, he consistently collaborates with numerous artists both in Australia and overseas.},

The Suicided Voice is the second piece in the Vox Circuit Trilogy, a series of interactive vocal works completed in 2007. In this piece the acoustic voice of the performer is “suicided” and given up to digital processing and physical re-embodiment. Dialogues are created between acoustic and digital voices. Gender specific registers are willfully subverted and fractured. Extended vocal techniques make available unusual acoustic resonances that generate rich processing textures and spiral into new acoustic and physical trajectories that traverse culturally specific boundaries crossing from the human into the virtual, from the real into the mythical. The piece is fully scored, there are no pre-recorded soundfiles used and no sound manipulation external to the performer’s control.
In The Suicided Voice the sensor interface of the Bodycoder System is located on the upper part of the torso. Movement data is mapped to live processing and manipulation of sound and images. The Bodycoder also provides the performer with real-time access to processing parameters and patches within the MSP environment. All vocalisations, decisive navigation of the MSP environment and Kinaesonic expressivity are selected, initiated and manipulated by the performer. The primary expressive functionality of the Bodycoder System is Kinaesonic. The term Kinaesonic is derived from the compound of two words: Kinaesthetic meaning the movement principles of the body and Sonic meaning sound. In terms of interactive technology the term Kinaesonic refers to the one-to-one, mapping of sonic effects to bodily movements. In our practice this is usually executed in real-time. The Suicided Voice was created in residency at the Banff Centre, Canada and completed in the electro-acoustic music facilities of the University of Huddersfield.

Etch is the third work in the Vox Circuit Trilogy (2007). In Etch extended vocal techniques, Yakut and Bell Canto singing, are coupled with live interactive sound processing and manipulation. Etch calls forth fauna, building soundscapes of glitch infestations, howler tones, clustering sonic-amphibians, and swirling flocks of synthetic granular flyers. All sounds are derived from the live acoustic voice of the performer. There are no pre-recorded soundfiles used in this piece and no sound manipulation external to the performer’s control. The ability to initiate, embody and manipulate both the acoustic sound and multiple layers of processed sound manipulated simultaneously on the limbs – requires a unique kind of perceptual, physical and aural precision. This is particularly evident at moments when the source vocal articulates of the performer, unheard in the diffused soundscape, enter as seemingly phantom sound cells pitch-changed, fractured and heavily processed. In such instances the sung score, and the diffused and physically manipulated soundscape seem to separate and the performer is seen working in counterpoint, articulating an unheard score. Etch is punctuated by such separations and correlations, by choric expansions, intricate micro constructions and moments when the acoustic voice of the performer soars over and through the soundscape.
Although the Bodycoder interface configuration for Etch is similar to that of The Suicided Voice, located on the upper torso - the functional protocols and qualities of physical expressivity are completely different. Interface flexibility is a key feature of the Bodycoder System and allows for the development of interactive works unrestrained by interface limitations or fixed protocols. The flexibility of the interface does however present a number of challenges for the performer who must be able to adapt to new protocols, adjust and temper her physical expressivity to the requirements of each piece.
The visual content of both Etch and The Suicided Voice was created in a variety of 2D and 3D packages using original photographic and video material. Images are processed and manipulated using the same interactive protocols that govern sound manipulation. Content and processing is mapped to the physical gestures of the performer. As the performer conjures extraordinary voices out of the digital realm, so she weaves a multi-layered visual environment combining sound, gesture and image to form a powerful ‘linguistic intent’.
Etch was created in residency at the Confederation Centre for the Arts on Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia in June 2007.

Silent Movies is an attempt to explore and confront some of the possible relationships / interdependencies between visual and sonic perception. In collaboration with a variety of moving image artists, this performance piece complicates visual engagement through performed / improvised sound. In a sense, Silent Movies plays with the live soundtrack idea, but from a somewhat different vantage point. Or maybe it is an inversion; a visual accompaniment to an improvised sonic landscape? For this performance, I will use a hybrid extended electric guitar / computer performance system, which allows me to explore extended playing techniques and sonic transformations provided by sensor controlled interactive digital signal processing. For tonight's performance, the moving image composition is by Mark Domino (fieldform.com).

Developed in Amsterdam, at STEIM, The Color of Waiting uses animation, movement and video to portray themes of expectation. This collaboration (between animator Nick Fox-Gieg, chorographer/dancer Alison Rootberg, composer/programmer Margaret Schedel, and set designer Abra Brayman) deals with the anticipation of events by understanding the way time unfolds. The performers shift between frustration and acceptance as they portray the emotions evoked when waiting for something or someone. The Color of Waiting is an experience and a mood, an abstraction depicting human interaction.

About the performers:
Alison Rootberg and Margaret Schedel founded The Kinesthetech Sense in 2006 with the intent to collaborate with visual artists, dancers, and musicians, creating ferociously interactive experiences for audiences throughout the world. Rootberg, the Vice President of Programming for the Dance Resource Center, focuses on incorporating dance with video while Schedel, an assistant professor of music at Stony Brook University, combines audio with interactive technologies. Oskar Fischinger once said that, "everything in the world has its own spirit which can be released by setting it in motion." Together Rootberg and Schedel create systems which are set in motion by artistic input, facilitating interplay between computers and humans. Kinesthetech Sense has had their work presented throughout the US, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and Mexico. For more info, please go to: www.ksense.org},

Inspired by the swirls, vortices and lemniscate like patterns created by moving water and other fluids, Sonic Construction uses the movement of coloured dyes in a semi-viscous liquid to generate and control sound. The work is performed by dropping different coloured dyes (red, green, yellow, blue) into a clear glass vessel filled with water, made slightly viscous through the addition of a sugar syrup (Figure 2). Through the use of video tracking, the speed, colour and spatial location of the different coloured drops of dye are analysed as they are dropped into the glass vessel and subsequently expand, swirl, coil and entwine in the water. The control data derived from the video tracking of the ink drops is used to define both the shape and the way in which individual grains of sound are combined using FOF (Fonction d’Onde Formatique translated as Formant Wave-Form or Formant Wave Function) synthesis [1] [2], to create a rich and varied timbral sound environment. In developing Sonic Construction I sought to create a system that would provide a sense of connection with the interactive processes being employed and at the same time to create a system over which I had only limited direct control; ideally being influenced by the system’s responses as much as I was influencing the system.
Timbres produced by the system include bass-rich pulse streams, vocal textures and a variety of bell like sounds. The fluid movement of the coloured dye in the liquid is further used to spatialise the outputs of the FOF synthesis. The video captured of the dyes in the liquid, used for motion analysis and colour matching, is also projected back into the performance space, slightly processed using contrast, saturation and hue effects.

About the performer:
Jon Drummond is a Sydney based composer and performer. His creative work spans the fields of instrumental music, electroacoustic, interactive, sound and new media arts. Jon’s electroacoustic and interactive work has been presented widely including the International Computer Music Conferences (Denmark 1994, Canada 1995, Greece 1997, China 1999, Singapore 2003), Electrofringe, Totally Huge New Music Festival, Darwin International Guitar Festival and the Adelaide Festival of Arts. Many of his acoustic and electronic compositions have been commissioned and performed by leading Australian performers and ensembles including austraLYSIS, The Song Company, Ros Dunlop and Kathleen Gallagher. Recently Jon has been exploring the use of environmental signals from the natural world as generative devices for creating electroacoustic sound - video tracking the fluid motions of water in "Sonic Construction" and the motion of air through the use of kites in "Sounding the Winds".},

The Mobile Phone Orchestra is a new repetoire-based ensemble using mobile phones as the primary musical instrument. The MoPhO Suite contains a selection of recent compositions that highlights different aspects of what it means to compose for and perform with such an instrument in an ensemble setting. Brief program note: The Mobile Phone Orchestra of CCRMA (MoPhO) presents an ensemble suite featuring music performed on mobile phones. Far beyond ring-tones, these interactive musical works take advantage of the unique technological capabilities of today's hardware, transforming phone keypads, built-in accelerometers, and built-in microphones into powerful and yet mobile chamber meta-instruments. The suite consists of selection of representative pieces:
***Drone In/Drone Out (Ge Wang): human players, mobile phones, FM timbres, accelerometers.
***TamaG (Georg Essl): TamaG is a piece that explores the boundary of projecting the humane onto mobile devices and at the same time display the fact that they are deeply mechanical and artificial. It explores the question how much control we have in the interaction with these devices or if the device itself at times controls us. The piece work with the tension between these positions and crosses the desirable and the alarming, the human voice with mechanical noise. The alarming effect has a social quality and spreads between the performers. The sounding algorithm is the non-linear circle map which is used in easier-to-control and hard-to-control regimes to evoke the effects of control and desirability on the one hand the the loss of control and mechanistic function on the other hand.
***The Phones and Fury (Jeff Cooper and Henri Penttinen): how much damage can a single player do with 10 mobile phones? Facilitating loops, controllable playback speed, and solo instruments.
***Chatter (Ge Wang): the audience is placed in the middle of a web of conversations...

Musicians use their acoustic instruments to playfully interact with a physically modelled virtual sound sculpture which is projected onto the screen.
The musicians use sounds produced on their acoustic instruments to reach into the virtual world and grasp, push and hit the sculpture. In response the structure glows, spins, bounces around and generates its own sounds. The pitch and timbre of the live acoustic sounds are captured and transformed by the virtual sculpture which sings back in its own way. Each individual object (or mass) in the physical model is linked to a synthesis engine which uses additive and subtractive synthesis techniques to produce a wide range of sonic textures.
The frequency of oscillators of the synthesis engines are set by the acoustic sounds played by the acoustic musicians and the volume of sound produced is controlled by the movement of the masses. The effect is that the sound sculpture produces evocative sounds clearly linked to the sonic gestures of the performers and the movement of the onscreen sculpture.
During performance the physical structure and characteristics of the sculpture are altered. Links between masses are cut, spring tension of the links
altered and damping is ramped up and down. Thus, while transparency of operation is maintained, the complexity of the interaction between the acoustic and electronic performers and the sound sculpture itself leads to rich conversational musical interactions.

About the performers:  Andrew Johnston is a musician and software developer living in Sydney, Australia. He completed a music performance degree at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1995 and has performed with several Australian symphony orchestras and a number of other ensembles.

Incorporating human and machine-generated material, a “realization” of the piece involves the management of a pool of audio files, MIDI files, and score fragments, which are drawn upon during performance. In this way, the performer is required to control and shape the various streams of material in the same way that a DJ would select and combine records during the structuring of a live set (an alternative realization of `Mutations' may involve the playback of mixed material, in which the trajectory of the narrative has been determined in advance). The supply of audio files, MIDI files, and score fragments used in the construction of the piece takes existing works from the piano repertoire as source material, both transformed and quoted intact, resulting in a spectrum of recognizability ranging from the easily identifiable, to the ambiguous, to the non-referential. The integration of this borrowed material within the three strands of the piece highlights various connections between traditional forms of musical borrowing, transformative imitation, improvisation, electroacoustic sound transformation and quotation, EDM sampling practices, remix practices and DJ performance. This version of `Mutations' features a pre-recorded electronic part, realized using a software application created by Jon Weinel.

  abstract  = {Program notes: This piece was written for Duo Contour, and uses the following poem `Under the Slates' by Martin Daws as its inspiration:
We are earth people

Long have we hidden
In the rock heavy heart
And harboured our strengths
Among the agonies of stone

Ours is the granite
Wind withered to pinnacles
And the whispered secret
Passed behind its scream

And the dark slate blasted
Into fragments of its nature
Shattered forgotten bodies
Patterned random
Heaped on houses

Dropped on churches
Silenced hymns
On buried villages lost to light

We mourn our eagles
Count our sheep
Lay our seed on crusted bed spring
Spines shrunk with the gravity
Dreams pulled out of star flight
Driven back to earth to bone
To wakeful vision raw with piling rock
Against the sun

We are the subjects of a skyline
Held in hard embrace
Its dark love a sanctuary
For our healing

The poem reflects Daws' response to the altered landscape formed by slate quarrying in the village of Bethesda in North Wales.
The role of the instrumentalists in this piece is to create a textural accompaniment to the words. Through different sound transformation techniques, the sounds of the instruments are altered in real-time to create word-painting effects.
Video sequences of the poet himself are juxtaposed against images of the area in question. These images are manipulated in real-time by the sound of the instruments themselves. The video imagery, like the music, is intended to re flect the meaning of the text. For this piece, I created my own software tools in Max/MSP/Jitter for live audio/video interaction.

  abstract  = {Program notes: This performance draws on a natural feature of a particular class of chaotic oscillators described by Julien Sprott, namely that they require a driving force in order to perform as chaotic attractors. In the unmodified equations driving forces are introduced mathematically, however, as we calculate the chaotic systems in real-time we open the door to using a performers audio signal as an input force.
This class of oscillator exhibits interesting behavior in response to different frequency inputs; in particular, the systems are sensitive to changes in low frequency tones. This encourages the use of Just Intonation as a method of determining tuning systems with easily defined difference tones; the scale developed by Kraig Grady features many difference tones in an excitable range for the chaotic oscillators.

About the performers:
Mark Havryliv is a doctoral student developing a haptic musical instrument at the University of Wollongong. Aside from that research, he is interested in the musical possibilities of integrating real-time sonification with other disciplines like game design and creative writing.

Kraig Grady, an Anaphorian now living in Australia, composes almost exclusively for acoustic instruments of his own making or modification tuned to just intonation. Often his work is combined with his Shadow Theatre productions. His work has been presented at Ballhaus Naunyn Berlin (Germany), the Chateau de la Napoule (France), the Norton Simon Museum of Art, the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum, the Pacific Asia Museum, the Los Angeles Philharmonics American Music Weekend and New Music America 1985. He was chosen by Buzz Magazine as one of the "100 coolest people in Los Angeles".},

LOLC was originally created by Akito van Troyer and Jason Freeman and is in active development at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology by Jason Freeman, Andrew Colella, Sang Won Lee and Shannon Yao. LOLC is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation as part of a larger research project on musical improvisation in performance and education (NSF CreativeIT#0855758).

  Licht & Hiebe (2010) is the first concert piece for the new Instrument: The ``Hexenkessel'' (witch's cauldron) is a modified 22" timpani that uses LLP technology to turn the drumhead into an intuitive multitouch-interface for the control of live-electronics \& dmx-stage-lights. The multitouch technique goes into symbiosis with a traditional instrument, keeping its acoustic qualities, but opening it to the vast possibilities of interactive multimedia. Besides the control of live-electronics the instrument features an interface to dmx-controlled stage-lights to create a situation of intense intermedial fireworks entirely controlled by the performer. The parts needed for this non-destructive timpani-hack cost less than \$500.

About the performers:

Jacob Sello (1976, Hamburg/Germany) studied Audio Engineering, Systematic Musicology and Multimedia Composition in Hamburg. He is highly interested in the exciting possibilities that arise from the conjunction of traditional acoustic instruments and state-of-the-art technology. Pieces for clarinet controlled RC- helicopters or DJ-driven pneumatically prepared disklavier pieces are the outcome.

Stefan Weinzierl (1985, Günzburg/Germany) is constantly searching for fascinating challenges beyond genre-boundaries; as a drummer in contemporary solo performances, classical ensembles and orchestras as well as in Jazz- and Rock/Pop bands. He graduated in educational sciences in Regensburg and completed the Percussion Master program at the HfMT Hamburg in 2010.},

  Refraction of Your Gaze by Indeterminate Variables (ROYGBIV) is an effort to interface sound and the visible spectrum with digital and analog media. A collage of field recording, synth pad, and mechanical noise, ROYGBIV unfolds as wavelengths of light are read with discrete color sensors. Data is communicated through microcontrollers to custom audio software and a slide projector reproduces images of the natural world. ROYGBIV is concerned with fundamental properties of sensing, perception, and the technologies that mediate such experience. Metaphysical dimensions of color and sound are implied as the projected image and rainbow form a dialectic between reflection and refraction.

Musically, "L'instant" is a musical interpretation of subatomic instantons, employing rotation and layering of parts who's rhythms and timbres are built out of the combining and crossing of series of numbers... The scenario is roughly “from the big bang to entropy”, and a “surround sound” 5.1 diffusion space is critical to the sense of immersion within the rotating sound objects and textures.

About the performer: Tom Mays: composer, computer musician and teacher, teaches at the National Superior Conservatory of Music in Paris, and is currently working on PhD at the University of Paris 8 with Horacio Vaggione. He is especially interested in gestural performance of real-time computer systems for both written and improvised music, as well as in interaction between music and video.},

  An interactive audiovisual feedback loop forms the basis of All Hail the Dawn. The instrument contains two simple light-sensitive oscillators.  A crude spectral analysis in Max/MSP is used to filter the oscillators as well as looped buffers recorded from the instrument.  A matrix of the spectral analysis, interactively altered in Jitter using audio data, is projected back onto the instrument and performer as a series of shifting patterns.  This setup allows both the graphics and sound to drive each other, creating an evolving audiovisual relationship sensitive to slight changes in position, sound or processing.

  The performance between electric violinist Victoria Johnson and Diemo Schwarz playing his interactive corpus-based concatenative synthesis software CataRT is an improvisation with two brains and four hands controlling one shared symbolic instrument, the sound space, built-up from nothing and nourished in unplanned ways by the sound of the instrument, explored and consumed with whatever the live instant filled it with. It creates a symbiotic relationship between the player of the instrument and that of the software. Live corpus-based concatenative synthesis permits here a new approach to improvisation, where sound from an instrument is recontextualised by interactive, gesture-controlled software. Not knowing what can happen is an integral part of the performance.

About the performers:

Victoria Johnson works with electric violin, live electronics, improvisation and musical technological issues in her artistic work. Trained as a classical violinist in Oslo, Vienna and London, she gave her debut recital in Oslo in 1995. She has established herself internationally as a soloist, chamber musician and improviser in contemporary, improvised and experimental, cross-disciplinary music and art.

Diemo Schwarz: Researcher and developer at Ircam, composer of electronic music, and musician on drums and laptop with gestural controllers. His compositions and live performances, in solo as Mean Time Between Failure, or improvising with other musicians, explore the possibilities of corpus-based concatenative synthesis to re-contextualise any sound source by rearranging sound units into a new musical framework using interactive navigation through a timbral space.},

  The Loop explores the possibilities of co-located performance, decentralized composition, and the acoustics of network. This performance begins with a brief improvisation presenting acoustic sources to excite the network. This material is shared, transformed, and reintroduced into the composition. This process continues through successive generations until a predetermined time or a point at which the composition naturally concludes. The result is an integrated meta-instrument and an emergent composition, with no one artist being the sole performer or composer. Remote participants are represented locally by a mono speaker enabling the audiences to hear the transformation of audio through the networked instrument.

  Dissonance is an audio/visual performance in which a progressive soundtrack is created along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment. While real instrument--generated music animates the projected worlds, the two performers are allowed to physically interact with virtual objects, changing their position, shape and color to control music and create new sounds. As the journey continues and the environment introduces new elements and new metaphors, performers are driven to explore the sonic laws that rule each scenario. Spectators wearing 3D glasses perceive the virtual environment as moving out of the screen and embracing the artists, in choreographies where real and virtual world literally overlap.

The visual component of Flayed/Flock is an enhanced flocking simulation that interacts with real-time audio from the performance of improvising musicians. Abstract patterns develop out of the flocking behavior; the flocks are also able to coalesce into well-defined symbols and forms such as crescents and stars, all while moving in a natural-looking manner consistent with flocking behavior. For more details, see Bill Hsu's poster in the conference proceedings.

  13 (Ivica Ico Bukvic): is a game of prime numbers and primal instincts pitting timbre against rhythm. Driven by conductor's oversight over an array of performer-specific and ensemble-wide parameters, a networked ensemble acts as one large meta-tracker where each individual performer contributes its own gesture-driven motives or tracks. The ensuing meta-tracker texture is superimposed against improvised acoustic percussion in a search of a meaningful discourse and ultimately musical synergy.

  Serene (Ivica Ico Bukvic): ...the one moment in the day when the world melts away and we catch a glimpse of life that just is... a celebration of this moment through juxtaposition of Taiji (Tai Chi Chuan) choreography and music...

 Citadel for soprano and L2Ork (Ivica Ico Bukvic) draws inspiration from a famous poem "Himna Slobodi" (Hymn to Freedom) by the 17th century Croatian poet Ivan Gundulic. As the first piece ever written for the newfound ensemble, it relies upon pervasive tonality, in many ways posing as an electronic counterpart to a traditional string ensemble. Using the infinite-bow metaphor to create lush tonal harmonies the piece forms a compelling aural foundation for a lyrical showcase of soloist's vocal talent.

=== About the performers:

L2Ork: Founded by Dr. Ivica Ico Bukvic in May 2009, is part of the latest interdisciplinary initiative by the Virginia Tech Music Department's Digital Interactive Sound \& Intermedia Studio (DISIS). As an emerging contemporary intermedia ensemble with a uniquely open design, L2Ork thrives upon the quintessential form of collaboration found in the western classical orchestra and its cross-pollination with increasingly accessible human-computer interaction technologies for the purpose of exploring expressive power of gesture, communal interaction, discipline-agnostic environment, and the multidimensionality of arts.

  This piece is written in consideration of two distinct paradigms: telematic music performance and human-machine improvisation. Specifically this work is a structured improvisation for three humans and one intelligent agent, being constrained by sections that determine which pairing (duos, trios) of performers are active. Instrumentation also changes between sections in a way that blurs the line of agency and intent between acoustic human performers, laptop tablet-based human performer, and agent improviser, as the two remote (NY, Stanford) acoustic performers (v-accordion, soprano saxophone) engage with the on-stage laptop performer (GREIS system) and ambient presence of the agent performer (spatialization, loops, textures).

The piece \emph{Floating Points II} is the result of the continued work of the instrument makers and performers Michael Vierling and Matthias Schneiderbanger within their self-developed system for collaborative performance including the digital musical instruments Sensor-table and Chirotron. These instruments use several sensors to transform the movements and gestures of their players into data for sound generation, placement and movement of the sound in the room.

The performances with \emph{Sensor-table} and \emph{Chirotron} emphasize the connection between the performer and the digital musical instruments by using the basic noise of the sensors as a notable characteristic in the sound synthesis to accentuate the technical boundaries in an aesthetic way. The network is the core of the common setup: It offers the ability to connect two physically separated instruments into one common signal chain for sound processing and spatialisation.

Water Birds is an interactive and collaborative composition for clarinet, bass clarinet and computer. The sound of the clarinets is processed live by spectral delays with MaxMSP and rtcmix~. Space structures the composition, as the particular sound parameters initiated depend on the performer's location on the stage. The development of the current version of the piece involved a custom wireless infrared sensor network, which responds to the clarinetist's movements. Currently the piece is performed without the sensor network, but the strategy of that configuration still drives the composition. A score containing five sound-generating ideas, consisting of musical fragments and a Zen poem, allows the performer to improvise, creating his/her own sound pathway through the piece. The pathway is reminiscent of the path of birds in the Zen poem, Dogen's \emph{On the Nondependence of Mind}, which reads: ``Water birds/going and coming/their traces disappear/but they never/forget their path.''

Adam \& Atau exploit a commonly available consumer electronics device, a smartphone, as an expressive, gestural musical instrument. The device is well known an iconic object of desire in our society of consumption, playing music as a fixed commodity. The performers re-appropriate the mobile phone and transform the consumer object into an instrument for concert performance. As a duo, with one in each hand, they create a chamber music, 4-hands iPhone. The accelerometers allow high precision capture of the performer's free space gestures. This drives a granular synthesis patch in Pure Data (PD), where one patch becomes the process by which a range of sounds from the natural world are stretched, frozen, scattered, and restitched. The fact that all system components---sensor input, signal processing and sound synthesis, and audio output, are embodied in a single device make it a self-contained, expressive musical instrument.

\emph{Aphasia} (2010), for solo performer and two-channel tape, was commissioned by the GRM, Paris and composed for virtuoso singer Nicholas Isherwood. The tape, an idiosyncratic explosion of warped and mangled sounds, is made up exclusively of vocal samples---all provided by Isherwood and subsequently transformed digitally.  Against the backdrop of this audio narrative, an elaborate set of hand gestures are performed---an assiduously choreographed sign language of sorts.  Each gesture is fastidiously synchronized to the tape in tight rhythmic coordination.

In the context of NIME, the piece is noteworthy for its deliberate---if unintentionally political---contemporary technology abstinence.  Ancillary questions arise, such as ``What are the present limits of gesture control?''; ``Do these limitations present unwelcome pressures on the boundaries of artistic imagination and creative capacity?''; and ``How do we learn to recognize when it is artistically prudent to eschew emerging tools?''

Two typical NIME related inventions meet in this performance. IRCAM based Diemo Schwarz and HKU lecturer and Electrumpet player Hans Leeuw met at STEIM in 2010. The extreme sound possibilities of the sensor driven Electrumpet combine wonderfully with the corpus based techniques in CataRT. Both Diemo and Hans play their self-invented instruments for a number of years in which they have done several iterations / extensions and built a lot of performance experience. This experience pays off in the expressive capabilities of both performers making this a concert that goes far beyond an extended demonstration of new instruments. In \emph{Violent Dreams}, Hans's manipulated sounds are recorded in CataRT, from which Diemo chooses specific sonic characters and evolutions via gestural controllers, that are played back and transformed by CataRT, challenging Hans to come up with more extreme sounds surpassing his own originals. Thus we get an interesting and challenging improvisation battle between two players that both fully master their instrument.

In 2008 he designed the Electrumpet, a hybrid electroacoustic instrument that differs from similar design in that it takes the trumpet players normal playing position and expression in account thus creating an instrument that combines acoustic and electronic expression seamlessly. (see `the electrumpet, additions and revisions')

Diemo Schwarz is a researcher and developer at Ircam, composer of electronic music, and musician on drums and laptop.  He holds a PhD in computer science applied to music for his research on corpus-based concatenative musical sound synthesis.
His compositions and live performances, under the name of his solo project Mean Time Between Failure, or improvising with musicians such as Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Blondy, Victoria Johnson, Pierre Alexandre Tremblay, Etienne Brunet, Luka Juhart, George Lewis, Evan Parker, explore the possibilities of corpus-based concatenative synthesis to re-contextualise any sound source by rearranging sound units into a new musical framework using interactive navigation through a sound space, controlled by gestural input devices.
His research work includes improving interaction between musician and computer, and exploiting large masses of sound for interactive real-time sound synthesis, collaborating with composers such as Philippe Manoury, Dai Fujikura, Stefano Gervasoni, Aaron Einbond, Sam Britton.

\emph{the ellipsis catalog} features new instruments designed by Kevin Patton and Butch Rovan. Patton's instrument, the ``Fossil'', is a wireless sensor-based musical instrument that is played with the entire gestural range of arm movement as well as finger pressure. Four FSRs, a momentary button, and a two-dimensional accelerometer are used to control the parameters of a custom software environment built in Max/MSP/Jitter. It is part of a group of four hand-carved wood instruments called the Digital Poplar Consort.

Rovan's ``Banshee'' is an analog electronic musical instrument. Modeled after a wind instrument, the design uses six finger pads to control the pitch of an array of interrelated oscillators, and a mouth sensor that allows the performer to control volume. The Banshee also features a tilt-sensor that allows motion to change the voicing circuitry and resulting timbre. Battery powered, the instrument can plug into any amplifier or mixing console, much like an electric guitar.

\emph{Clarinet} is the third piece in a series of monotimbral works.  Like its siblings \emph{Piano} and \emph{Cymbal}, it was inspired by the sound qualities of an acoustic instrument. This minimalist and meditative piece is a structured improvisation performed on the sponge, a musical interface designed by the composer. The sponge is basically a cushion equipped with sensors (accelerometers, buttons and force sensing resistors) which detect when it is squeezed, twisted or shaken.  Because the sponge evolves continuously, the piece exists in many versions.  Each new version drifts further away from the original compositional intentions and the piece is slowly becoming less meditative.  The latest version is subtitled Albino Butterfly.

Artist(s) Biography:

Martin Marier is a composer and a performer who is mainly interested in live electronic music using new interfaces.  He is the inventor of the sponge, a cushion like musical interface that he uses to perform his pieces.  The main goal of this approach is to establish a natural link between gesture and sound in electronic music.  He aims at improving the interaction with the audience and at making the process of composing more playful.  His research on the sponge is the topic of the doctorate he is pursuing at the Universit de Montral under the supervision of Prof. Jean Pich\'{e}.  He was also supervised by Dr. Garth Paine during an exchange at the University of Western Sydney (Australia) in 2011.
Martin has also composed music for theatre, collaborating mostly with the Th\'{e}\^{a}tre I.N.K. company for whom he wrote the music of three plays: "L'effet du temps sur Mat\'{e}vina" (2012), "Roche, papier... couteau" (2007), "La cadette" (2006).  He sometimes writes music for films and collaborates with the film composer Benoit Charest. He is one of the founders of Point d'\'{e}coute (PDE), a collective whose purpose is to promote electroacoustic music.  Along with his four colleagues of PDE, he produced concerts in Montreal, New York and Sydney.

\emph{Music for Sleeping \& Waking Minds} (2011-2012) is an overnight event in which four performers fall asleep while wearing custom designed EEG sensors, which monitor their brainwave activity over the course of one night. The data gathered from the EEG sensors is applied in real time to different audio and image signal processing functions, resulting in a continuously evolving multi-channel sound environment and visual projection. This material serves as an audiovisual description of the individual and collective neurophysiological state of the ensemble, with sounds and images evolving according to changes in brainwave activity. Audiences, who are invited to bring anything that they need to ensure comfortable sleep, can experience the work in different states of attention: while alert and sleeping, resting and awakening.

Artist(s) Biography:

Gascia Ouzounian is a violinist, musicologist, and composer. She has performed with such varied ensembles as Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble at Carnegie Hall, Bang On A Can All-Stars at the Mass MOCA, Sinfonia Toronto at the Toronto Centre for the Arts, and the Theatre of Eternal Music Strings Ensemble at the Dream House. Gascia's recent projects include two compositions that are intended for overnight listening: EDEN EDEN EDEN with filmmaker Chloe Griffin, and \emph{Music for Sleeping \& Waking Minds} with R. Benjamin Knapp, Eric Lyon and R. Luke DuBois. In the latter, an ensemble of sleeping performers generates an audiovisual environment through their neurophysiological activity over the course of one night. Gascia teaches at Queen's University Belfast, where she leads the performance programme in the School of Creative Arts. Her writings on experimental music and sound art appear in numerous academic journals and the book \emph{Paul DeMarinis: Buried in Noise.}

R. Benjamin Knapp is the founding director of the Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology at Virginia Tech, where he is Professor of Computer Science. Ben has led the Music, Sensors and Emotion (MuSE) group, whose research focuses on the understanding and measurement of the physical gestures and emotional states of musical performers and their audience. For over 20 years, Ben has been researching and developing user-interfaces and software that enable composers and performers to augment the physical control of a musical instrument with more direct neural interaction. From the invention of the Biomuse with Hugh Lusted in 1987 to the introduction of the concept of an Integral Music Controller (a generic class of controllers that use the direct measurement of motion and emotion to augment traditional methods of musical instrument control) in 2005, Ben has focused on creating a user-aware interface based on the acquisition and real-time analysis of biometric signals.

Eric Lyon is a composer and computer music researcher. During the 1980s and 1990s, his fixed media computer music focused on spectral and algorithmic processing of audio, with a tendency toward extreme modifications of samples, variously sourced. From the early 1990s, Lyon became involved with live computer music, performing solo, and in the Japanese band Psychedelic Bumpo, with the Kyma system. Later in the 1990s, he gravitated toward software-based live processing, starting to develop Max/MSP externals in 1999. This work resulted in his LyonPotpourri collection of Max/MSP externals, and the FFTease spectral package, developed in collaboration with Christopher Penrose. In recent years, Lyon has focused on computer chamber music, which integrates live, iterative DSP strategies into the creation of traditionally notated instrumental scores. Other interests include spatial orchestration, and articulated noise composition. Lyon teaches computer music in the School of Music and Sonic Art at Queen's University Belfast.

R. Luke DuBois is a composer, artist, and performer who explores the temporal, verbal, and visual structures of cultural and personal ephemera. He has collaborated on interactive performance, installation, and music production work with many artists and organizations including Toni Dove, Matthew Ritchie, Todd Reynolds, Jamie Jewett, Bora Yoon, Michael Joaquin Grey, Elliott Sharp, Michael Gordon, Maya Lin, Bang on a Can, Engine27, Harvestworks, and LEMUR, and was the director of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra for its 2007 season. Stemming from his investigations of ``time-lapse phonography,'' his recent work is a sonic and encyclopedic relative to time-lapse photography. Just as a long camera exposure fuses motion into a single image, his work reveals the average sonority, visual language, and vocabulary in music, film, text, or cultural information. He teaches at the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, and is on the Board of Directors of Issue Project Room.

\emph{Of Dust and Sand} uses the Electromagnetically-Prepared Piano device, a rack of 12 electromagnets which is suspended over the strings of a piano. Each electromagnet is sent an audio signal and in turn excites its respective string, much like a stereo speaker made from piano strings. In this piece a subset of the magnets remains active throughout, the performer physically silencing the strings by pressing down with fingertips. Thus the instrument becomes a kind of anti-piano---lifting a finger frees a string to vibrate, producing sound. In addition, various items, such as paper and a plastic ruler, rest directly on the strings further altering the timbre. Remember---everything you hear is entirely acoustic.

Of Dust and Sand is dedicated to The Kenners.

\emph{Jack Walk} explores notions of ecstatic energy, control and release. The work begins with live and fixed percussion lines, re-processed into a series of electronic representations of specified structure. This provides a compositional framework that a percussionist interacts with, while in another sonic layer, a laptop musician simultaneously samples and re-processes the live percussion while channeling the audio back into the larger environment. A videographer mixes imagery related to the original compositional notions of ecstatic control and release. Layers of sonic material emanating from the drummer's kit blur the virtual and real, while the music and imagery evoke imaginary lines tracing physical and conceptual flows of energy. The trio of performers for the NIME 2012 performance of \emph{Jack Walk} (Deal, Drews, and Munson) comprise group known as Big Robot, an Indianapolis-based computer-acoustic trio that creates live, interactive, and media-enriched works.

\emph{Flue} is a structured audio-visual improvisation for three musicians, utilizing live acoustic and electronic sound and interactive animations. A physics-based smoke simulation is influenced by the real-time audio from the musicians' performance. The audio from the performance is analyzed; high-level tempo, spectral and other features are extracted, and sent via Open Sound Control to the animation environment. The smoke trails are also able to coalesce into well- defined symbols and forms, all while moving in a natural-seeming manner consistent with the underlying fluid simulation.

The most impressive uses of the theremin cello during Theremin's time in New York are Leopold Stokowski's inclusion of one in the Philadelphia Orchestra's low string section and Varese's composition of two solo parts in Ecuatorial.  Even more important, from my perspective, is the fact that the instrument represents the first attempt to harness the human potential to shape and manipulate electronic sound by means of the technical apparatus of the modern player of bowed string instruments.

Rachmaninoff's Vocalise, Op. 34 no. 14, for textless high voice, highlights the hauntingly vocal quality of the theremin cello. Vocalise is the last of a set of 14 songs published in 1912, less than a decade before Theremin's experiments with musical sounds began to bear fruit.

Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, by virtue of their use of Bob Whitsell's Electro-Theremin on several recordings, are irrevocably linked to the history of the theremin.

The MiND Ensemble (Music in Neural Dimensions) is a new-media performance group that utilizes custom interfaces to explore the mind-machine-music connection. The traditional realization of the creative process ahs been as follows: there is an artist, a thought process, and a fixed medium which actualizes those thoughts. Neurofeedback radically shifts this paradigm. Now there is an artist and a dynamic medium that actively interfaces with the thought processes of the artist himself, drastically reshaping the way we understand the creative process. The MiND Ensemble promotes a rich awareness in which the mind is the creative medium. All projection and audio processing in this piece are driven in real time, with data gathered from the Emotiv EPOC headset.

\emph{Eigenspace} (2011) is a collaborative project with Japan's leading visual artist in new media, Tomoyuki Kato (Movie Director), with Yoshito Onishi (Image Programing), and Chisako Hasegawa (Producer).  As Japanese, we were deeply touched by the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the worst manmade catastrophe in the history of the human kind, which is not contained today contaminating the globe.  Eigenspace is about our love and prayer for the humankind and our planet, and for the next generation. The name is also taken from ``eigenvalue,'' a mathematical function used in analyzing the bowing movement, which interacts in real time with Mr. Kato's software.  The musical expression is extracted by IRCAM's ``Augmented Violin'' and their newest motion sensor ``mini-MO'', custom-fit into a glove designed by Mark Salinas. Special thanks to the Real Time Musical Interactive Team at IRCAM. Eigenspace was commissioned by Harvestworks, and premiered at Roulette in Brooklyn, on October 9th, 2011.

\emph{Where Are You Standing?} (2012) is a collaborative mobile music piece using the digital compass on mobile phones as an intuitive, interactive musical instrument. The piece features performers on stage making sound by aiming at other performers: compass-measured orientation of each aiming gesture is mapped to a specific musical note depending on which player is aimed at, and is visualized on screen in real-time.

The piece begins with three performers playing ``harmonic'' sounds by taking aim at each other. This consonance is broken by the introduction of the fourth performer who represents conflict: the notes played by this performer as well as the notes played by others when they aim at this performer are dissonant to cause musical tension. Finally, the last performer leaves the stage to resolve the tension, and the piece ends with three performers back in congruity.

An improvised performance on a custom built instrument, using a simple pencil drawing as a gestural interface for controlling complex analog synthesis. The interface works by using the resistive properties of carbon to create a voltage potential field in the graphite/pencil markings on the paper using custom movable electrodes, made from coins. Then, control voltages are extracted from other points on the paper, controlling various aspects of the synthesized sound. The design was inspired by my previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is very lo-tech, easy to build, and should be possible to use with any analogue modular synthesizer. Here, I use it with a Bugbrand modular, built by Tom Bugs in Bristol, UK. The interface is presented in more detail in a paper presentation at the NIME conference.

Many of the discourses around technological development in music are deeply concerned with aspects of control; i.e. how does one exert their control, or ``mastery'' over the technology they use. However, we propose that technological systems with a certain amount of unpredictability and randomness may also be useful, especially for improvisation. As an improvisation duo, our method often involves designing electronic instruments whose behaviors are somewhat unpredictable. As a result, our entire aesthetic is largely based on ``riding'' the boundary of control. Working in this way creates a situation where we are often forced to react to, and work with, the unexpected.

Our improvisation features a number of handmade and hacked electronic instruments, all of which have been designed to behave somewhat unpredictably.

This work merges sound and light to illuminate complex rhythmic motives, polyrhythms and metrical patterns in a visual display generated by three drummers playing six ``light'' drums. These new instruments bring to life the dreams of 20th century synesthetes, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Alexander Scriabin and others who sought to create an imagined ``visual music,'' an ideal synthesis of music and visual art.

Community Light Beacons are percussion instruments that leverage the potentials of music, analog technology, and human-generated power to visualize sound. These instruments add the dimension of light to the ancient tradition of drumming. The drums are user-powered, and when they are played---banged, hit and tapped---the vibrations from the drumhead are converted to electricity by the internal speaker transducer. The generated energy powers ultra bright LEDs, which light up with every hit and beam out from the Fresnel lens.

\emph{InHands}, an audiovisual real-time improvisation for mobile phones, explores alternative options for musical interactions with two mobile instruments in live performances. In this improvisation piece, sound output of each mobile phone instrument becomes a sound input for the other instrument; to be processed further with an act of responding immediately and spontaneously. Granular synthesis module captures audio in real-time and creates the grains based on the texture of the sounds. Magnitude, roll and pitch values of the acceleration are mapped to the control parameters.  In the control layer of Sub-synthesis module, the change in direction of a touch position is tracked on the mobile surface and the distance of the same touch position to 4 certain points on the touchscreen is used as a source for creating frequency values. This mapping model generates 4 control parameters throughout 2 dimensional input layers. Hannah Drayson created the abstract visual-layers of this piece.

When designing my new electronic instruments, I always keep in mind the relationship between the instrument and performer as a tool and its master. The instrument should be a channel by which the performer can access the dimensions of sound in order to attempt to make music. The music should then originate from the musicians intention and not the instrument itself. Thus, I design my instruments as intuitive, transparent, and non-idiosyncratic mappings between physical gesture and sound.

This new electronic instrument remaps a Logitech Attack 3 Joystick to be able to control sound. Through the joystick, the performer can control volume, rhythm, repetition, and pitch of custom, preprogrammed sounds. Additionally, the joystick can be used to record and playback short audio loops. The product of this design allows for agile and intentional electronic musical gestures where rhythm, volume, and pitch are clear and deliberate. I have been able to reach a wide range of musical expressions and I am learning and discovering more as I practice MODIFIED ATTACK.

\emph{Fragments} is an improvisational performance piece that utilizes physical treatments inside an acoustic piano, as well as digital treatments provided by computer-based digital signal processing. In addition to using a few simple physical controls (foot pedals and custom iPad interface) this piece also uses the performed audio stream as a gestural control source. The preformed audio stream is analyzed and important features are extracted. The current state and trajectory of these audio features are used to influence the behavior of the real-time signal processing environment. This creates a computer-mediated performance system that combines the capabilities of computation and sound processing with the tactile and expressive intimacy of the prepared acoustic piano. \emph{Fragments} invites the listener into a unique and complex sonic environment where expectation, repetition, spontaneity, and discovery are intertwined.

In this piece we explore the personality of the ``post-modern man''. Exposed to aggressive stimulation and overwhelming data streams, he must make important choices to follow a rational ``mind path'' while his time quickly runs out. The performer, impersonating the post-modern man, wears an electro-encephalographic headset that detects his mind activity. The analysis of its output reveals the power of the performer's three thoughts which are connected to forward movement, turn left, and turn right in the virtual maze projected on a screen.

Despite the distracting external forces, embodied by the sound and flickering visuals, the performer must remain paradoxically calm to generate the correct states of mind that let him navigate his way out of the maze. Every time the performer crosses a red boundary in the maze, he gets closer to the exit, and a new stochastic musical scene is triggered. The time and structure of the composition is thus entirely determined by the choices and concentration of the performer.

\emph{M\aa ne Havn (mounhoun)} is an improvisational multi-media performance system for extended vibraphone with accompanying custom LED sculptures and projected visuals. The music draws specifically from NYC free jazz, the funeral music of the Lobi people of northern Ghana, Dub, psych rock and minimalism. Abstract interactive light sculptures actuated from the instrument's audio and controller data will accompany the performance, creating a visually shifting immersive space. The sculptures, named `Takete' and `Maluma', reference Gestalt psychology and the known correlation between our perceptions of sound and light. Mappings will reflect this phenomenon. The piece uses a pitched percussion tool suite developed by the Music Intelligence \& Sound Technology Collective at the University of Victoria, including: Magic Eyes (3D gesture controller), Ghost Hands (control data looper), MSTR DRMMR++ (rhythm template as control switches), Fantom Faders (vibraphone bars as control faders) and Gyil Gourd (physical modeling of the Lobi xylophone's gourd resonator).

Artist(s) Biography:

Shawn Trail: Electro-acoustic percussionist, \textbf{Shawn Trail}, designs and builds new performance technologies for acoustic pitched percussion instruments integrating musical robotics, physical modeling synthesis, and HCI. He was Control Interface and Robotics Technician for Pat Metheny's Orchestrion World Tour (2010), Fulbright Scholar at Medialogy- Aalborg University, Copenhagen researching DSP, synthesis, and HCI (2009), and composer-in-residence with League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots (2008). In 2002 he conducted field research in Ghana on the Gyil (traditional xylophone). He has a Master of Music in Studio Composition from Purchase Conservatory of Music and a BA in percussion performance and music technology. He is an Interdisciplinary PhD candidate in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Music with MISTIC at the University of Victoria. Performing solo under the moniker TXTED, his multi- media performance works singularly revolve around minimal, textural evolving polyrhythmic, melodic ostinati propelled by a sense of urgency intrinsic to cultural music rituals informed by specific traditions.

Thor Kell: As a composer, programmer, and DJ, \textbf{Thor Kell} likes combining interesting things in unique ways. A recent graduate of the University of Victoria's Music / Computer Science program, he will begin his MA at McGill University in the fall, focusing on interactions between performer, interface, and software. While at UVic, he received a Jamie Cassels Undergraduate Research Award: his research involved prototyping and composing for a gestural control mapping system for extending the marimba. His traditional compositions are all clockwork riffs and hidden structures, based on mathematical constants or time- stretched quotes from the English folk music canon: he has written for everything from full orchestra to solo piano. He has programmed for The Echo Nest and SoundCloud. In his secret life as a DJ and techno maven, he has released chart-toppers on Kompakt, impossibly deep jams on Fade, and hour-long remix / video symphonies on his own label, Tide Pool.

Gabrielle Odowichuk is a graduate student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Victoria, working in the MISTIC research lab. A specialist in DSP and MIR, her research has focused on sound spatialization and gesture-based control of sound and music, developing a variety of prototypes, including Fantom Faders and Magic Eyes, the mallet tracking and gesture control applications used in this performance. For M\o{a}ne Havn (mounhoun), she draws on previous experience in art direction and stage design to produce unique real-time gesture-controlled visualizations. She designed, built, and developed the interactive LED sculptures, Takete and Maluma, used in this piece, as well as the projections. Her work has been published by ICMC, IEEE, and NIME.

\emph{Texturologie 12: Gesture Studies} (2011) is the most recent of my series of pieces that explore the creation of intricate continuous-field textures (and borrow the name of a series of paintings by Dubuffet). In this piece, I return to my explorations of the potential of the Wii\texttrademark remote to control computer music in performance. This time, I tried to treat the physical gesture as the germ or motive for the music. Some of the gestures are abstract, but some are suggestive of familiar activities like petting a cat, ringing a bell, smoothing wallpaper , playing a guiro, scooping, tapping, or vigorous stirring. (Check out the videos of my other Wiii\texttrademark pieces on YouTube. Search ``Caldwell wii.'')

Mimi, designed by Alexandre Fran\c{c}ois with input from Elaine Chew and Isaac Schankler, is a multi-modal interactive musical improvisation system that explores the impact of visual feedback in performer-machine interaction. The Mimi system enables the performer to experiment with a unique blend of improvisation-like on-the-fly invention, composition-like planning and choreography, and expressive performance. Mimi's improvisations are created through a factor oracle. The visual interface gives the performer and the audience instantaneous and continuous information on the state of the oracle, its recombination strategy, the music to come, and that recently played. The performer controls when the system starts, stops, and learns, the playback volume, and the recombination rate. Mimi is not only an effective improvisation partner, it also provides a platform through which to interrogate the mental models necessary for successful improvisation. This performance also features custom synths and mechanisms for inter-oracle interaction created for Mimi by Isaac Schankler.

\emph{The Theremin Orchestra} is a composition for three voices and a modular system of four spheres with built-in Theremin Sensors. Two of those spheres will control different effects on the voices and the rest will be played as Theremin instruments. The performance is presented as a sound event where initially the three voices appear raw and naked and as the composition unfolds the voices will be increasingly distorted through different effects applied with the Theremin controllers. In the climax of its progression the other two Theremin balls will become audible merging their sound with the mesh of vocal reshaped sources, not allowing to distinguish where the human ends and the machine starts.

Artist(s) Biography:

Merche Blasco: Trained as a Telecommunications Engineer, \textbf{Merche Blasco} developed in parallel to her studies a more creative path related with music, video, installation and performance. She created her alter ego ``Burbuja'' as a vehicle for her own musical exploration and since its conception she has participated \& collaborated with various artists, establishing a strong relationship between different mediums of artistic expression  \& her own musical direction lsuch as Lucy Orta at the Venice biennale, Chicks on Speed and Cristian Vogel.
Her debut,``burbuja'' (station55 records) was presented in Sonar 2007 and has been touring in different cities in Europe, USA and Canada in the past years: Mapping Festival (Geneve), Sonic Art Circuits (Washington), Queens Museum of Art (New York). Thanks to a Fulbright Grant she is currently a MPS Candidate in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU) where she is mainly researching about new tools for Electronic Music Performance.

Thessia Machado, Brazil/NY, investigates the physicality of sound and its effect on our perception of space. Many of her recent sculptures and installations function also as unorthodox instruments---pieces that have a real-time, live component. The expressive potential is active and changeable as the viewer interacts and performs with it. Thessia's installations and video pieces have been exhibited in New York, London, Philadelphia, Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin, Berlin and Athens.
She has been awarded residencies at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, the Atlantic Center for the Arts, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Vermont Studio Center and she is a recipient of fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts, The Experimental Television Center and The Bronx Museum. Performing as link, Thessia Machado, a self-avowed noisician, employs a changing line-up of handmade, found and modified instruments to build driving, meditative soundscapes.

Sonia Megias was born on June 20th 1982 in Almansa, a village at the southeast of Spain. Since she was a kid, she has been abducted by the arts, nature and spirituality. Even today, some years later, she tries to interweave these beautiful disciplines, with the goal of transmit to the world her perception of Beauty or True.
Thanks to the intensity of her musical production, she finds herself living in New York since 2010, on the Fulbright and a NYU Steinhardt grants. Here, she combines her studies at the New York University with the compositions of her last commissioned pieces.
Her music has been performed in different music halls and festivals, underlining the following: Auditorio 400 at the National Museum of Contemporary Art ``Queen Sophia'' (2012, 2008); Cervantes Institute of New York (2012, 2011); Houston University, at Opera Vista Festival (2011); Consulate of Argentina in New York, at a Tribute to Alfonsina Storni (2009); Embassy of France in Spain (2009); United Nations Headquarters (2008).

\emph{Stelaextraction} uses the electronic extension capabilities of the Yerbanaut to construct a musical composition through self-reference across different timescales. The Yerbanaut is a custom electro-acoustic kalimba built from a yerba mate gourd, with the tines placed in a circular pattern rather than the usual horizontal arrangement. Its sensors are intended to make use of this new arrangement, with force-sensitive buttons giving the otherwise inert left hand expressive capabilities, and a distance sensor allowing the right hand's motion to determine aspects of the processing. In Stelaextraction, all acoustic and processed sounds are recorded to a single buffer, the contents of which can be scrubbed through using the right hand's distance sensor. In this way, past musical gestures can be explored and then re-explored, with the recursive processing developing self-similar musical patterns over the course of the piece.

\emph{Fieldwork} is a software environment for improvised performance with electronic sound and animation. Two musicians' sounding performances are fed into the system, and analyzed for pitch, rhythm, and timbral change. When the software recognizes a sharp contrast in one performer's textures or gestures, it reflects this change by transforming the sound of the other musician's performance. Not only are the musicians responding to one another as in conventional improvisation, but they are also able to directly modify their duo partner's sound through the software. Fieldwork emphasizes rapid, glitchy, and polyrhythmic distortions of the musician's performances, and establishes unpredictable feedback processes that encourage unexpected improvisational relationships between the performers and computer.

Artist(s) Biography:

Christopher Burns is a composer, improviser, and multimedia artist. His instrumental chamber works weave energetic gestures into densely layered surfaces. Polyphony and multiplicity also feature in his electroacoustic music, embodied in gritty, rough-hewn textures. As an improviser, Christopher combines an idiosyncratic approach to the electric guitar with a wide variety of custom software instruments. Recent projects emphasize multimedia and motion capture, integrating performance, sound, and animation into a unified experience. Across these disciplines, his work emphasizes trajectory and directionality, superimposing and intercutting a variety of evolving processes to create form.
Christopher is an avid archaeologist of electroacoustic music, creating and performing new digital realizations of classic music by composers including Cage, Ligeti, Lucier, Nancarrow, Nono, and Stockhausen. A committed educator, he teaches music composition and technology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. He has studied composition with Brian Ferneyhough, Jonathan Harvey, Jonathan Berger, Michael Tenzer, and Jan Radzynski.

This performance aims to approach the next style of ``mashup'' and/or ``Cut-up'' via fusion of paradigms of artificial-life and turntable. We developed a system named ``SoniCell'' to realize it. SoniCell employs four robots called ``cell''. Each cell behaves as a metaphor of life based on a simple interaction model with prey-predator relationship. Each cell is assigned a music-track in the manner of turntable. Therefore, the system reconstructs and mixes the music-tracks via cells' interactions and performers' interventions. In this framework, the aspects of the system and performers interactions and cells' internal-states create structures of sounds and music from different tracks.

\emph{DaisyLab} is a duet performance for two new interfaces for musical expression that have in common the ability to generate versatile vocal material. Diemo Schwarz's instrument uses a variety of sensors on the top of corpus-based concatenative synthesis, which has been fed with voice sounds for this performance. Nicolas d'Alessandro plays the HandSketch interface over the new MAGE speech synthesizer, bringing tangible inputs to an emerging speech synthesis technique. Both systems have been submitted as long papers for this 2012 edition of NIME. Together these two performers explore the boundaries between vocal and non-vocal sonic spaces, aiming at deconstructing the humankind's most ubiquitous communicative channel through a compositionally directed improvisation, a ``comprovisation.''

  abstract = {Borrowed voices is a performance featuring performative voice synthesis, with two types of instruments: C-Voks and T-Voks. The voices are played a cappella in a double choir of natural and synthetic voices. Performative singing synthesis is a new paradigm in the already long history of artificial voices. The singing voice is played like an instrument, allowing singing with the borrowed voice of another. The relationship of embodiment between the singer's gestures and the vocal sound produced is broken. A voice is singing, with realism, expressivity and musicality, but it is not the musician's own voice, and a vocal apparatus does not control it. The project focuses on control gestures: the music explores vocal sounds produced by the vocal apparatus (the basic sound material), and “played” by the natural voice, by free-hand Theremin-controlled gestures, and by writing gestures on a graphic tablet. The same (types of) sounds but different gestures give different musical “instruments” and expressive possibilities. Another interesting aspect is the distance between synthetic voices and the player, the voice being at the same time embodied (by the player gestures playing the instrument with her/his body) and externalized (because the instrument is not her/his own voice): two different voices sung/played by the same person.}

  abstract = {colligation (to bring or tie together) is a physical performance work for one performer that explores the idea of sculpting sound through gesture. Treating sound as if it were a tangible object capable of being fashioned into new sonic forms, "pieces" of sound are captured, shaped and sculpted by the performer's hand and arm gestures, appearing pliable as they are thrown around and transformed into new sonic material. colligation uses two Thalmic Labs Myo armbands, one placed on the left arm and the other on the right arm. The Myo Mapper [1] software is used to transmit scaled data via OSC from the armbands to Pure Data. Positional (yaw, pitch and roll) and electromyographic data (EMG) from the devices are mapped to parameters controlling a hybrid synth created in Pure Data. The synth utilises a combination of Phase Aligned Formant synthesis [2] and Frequency Modulation synthesis [3] to allow a range of complex audio spectra to be explored. Pitch, yaw and roll data from the left Myo are respectively mapped to the PAF synth's carrier frequency (ranging from 8.175-12543.9Hz), bandwidth and relative centre frequency. Pitch, yaw and roll data from the right Myo are respectively mapped to FM modulation frequency (relative to and ranging from 0.01-10 times the PAF carrier frequency), modulation depth (relative to and ranging from 0.01-10 times the PAF carrier frequency), and modulation wave shape (crossfading between sine, triangle, square, rising sawtooth and impulse). Data from the left and right Myo's EMG sensors are mapped respectively to amplitude control of the left and right audio channels, giving the performer control over the level and panning of the audio within the stereo field. By employing both positional and bio data, an embodied relationship between action and response is created; the gesture and the resulting sonic transformation become inextricably entwined.}

Our challenge is to perform a chain of short fragmental elements in tandem in the way to form a single musical unit, while the algorithms for transformation are autonomously changing synthetic and control parameter settings.

This was the question I attempted to explore when I started making this project. For this project, I combine the movement of dancing with music to present a fluid and dynamic shape of musical instrument. The fabric of this instrument can be separated as an extension to wash. It's portable, wireless, chargeable, stable and beautiful. This musical instrument generates sound by detecting different movements of the performer. It has four different modes selected by toggling the switches on the instrument interface. Each mode has different movement detection methods, generating various sound and music. Moreover, it can be played as a transmitting Tambourine. As for the music in my performance, it's all played by myself lively, consisting of different sound triggered and changed by performers' gestures and melody composed myself. Like the name of this instrument River, the four toggles and their detection methods and their corresponding generated sounds are intentionally designed. From simple node, beat, loop, drum, to various node, melody, music, the detection methods and their triggered sounds are becoming more and more complex and various, developing like a journey of a river.}

The Atlantic Ocean, which separates and unites the two countries, serves as an inspiration for this quadraphonic performance, involving musical instruments and live electronics, where the sounds move through the four speakers. Each speaker symbolizes the paths that the sea travels uninterruptedly, in a unique dance of latitudes and longitudes. The intersection of sounds occurs through processes of reverberations, spatializations, echoes, modulations and grains that slowly form the sound material, composing, decomposing and manipulating the sound waves. Sound characters such as wind, oars, storms, calm, among others, are metaphorically evidenced through the sound material, creating a kind of rhythmic movement of a caravel at sea. The sounds of "Tanto Mar" move between entropy and chaos, between stillness and tsunami, between starboard and port, culminating in a textural dance where the objective is to take the listener away from electronic processing, and propose a dive in an intensified, attentive, deep and involving listening. New musical possibilities can happen through the experimentation of new routes, unusual routes and horizons not yet covered. The sea and its imprecise distances represent permanent challenges. "Tanto Mar" seeks to revive the feeling of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, when he wrote: "to dream even if it is impossible".}

  abstract = {This work is a continuation of my research into developing new performance ecosystems for improvisation. For this project I developed a new volatile assemblage, aka VOLA. My self-designed musical instruments are shaped by my history as a performer working in acoustic, mechanical, electronic and digital musics, blending and exploring the boundaries and breaking points of these different domains. My instruments support many of my existing techniques originally developed on more conventional instruments, while also affording the development of extended and novel techniques and performance strategies. In much of my work I am particularly focused on the exploration of musical timbre and texture; however, for this project my attention is also directed towards time, flow, pulse, duration, friction, disruption – in short, qualitative rhythms and defamiliarisation.}

  abstract = {What if a musician could step outside the familiar instrumental paradigm and adopt a new embodied language for moving through sound with a dancer in true partnership? And what if a dancer's body could coalesce with a musician's skills and intuitively render movements into instrumental actions for active sound- making? Vrengt is a multi-user instrument, specifically developed for music-dance performance, with a particular focus on exploring the boundaries between standstill vs motion, and silence vs sound. We sought for creating a work for one, hybrid corporeality, in which a dancer and a musician would co-creatively and co- dependently interact with their bodies and a machine. The challenge, then, was how could two performers with distinct embodied skills unite in a continuous entanglement of intentions, senses and experiences to control the same sonic and musical parameters? This was conceptually different than they had done before in the context of interactive dance performances.}

  abstract = {The key for a collective process of free improvisation is the interaction, dependence and surrender of its parts, so the resulting sound flux is more than the sum of each individual layer. The We Bass performance is an exploration of the symbiosis of two performers playing the same instrument: Their actions have direct consequence on the resulting sound, challenging the other player with instability and interference. From the experiments of the English scientist Thomas Young (1773-1829) on the phenomena of diffraction and interference of light waves, we observe that interferences generated by overlapping light waves can have a character of annihilation, when they are out of phase (destructive interference), or a reinforcing character when in phase (constructive interference). From this reflection we try to deepen the discussion about the interferences of the performers inputs involved in a free improvisation session. We seek a model of connection between the performers that promotes processes of creation in the free improvisation, exploring the dialectics between reinforcement actions (processes of interaction that reinforces a certain sound moment) and movement actions (that destabilizes and transforms the flow). We Bass is a duo performance exploring the interactions between the musicians playing one hybrid machine: an electric upright bass guitar with live electronics processing. The instrument consists of an electric upright bass with movement sensors and a live processing machine with a controller that interacts with the sensors, changing some processing parameters and some controller mapping settings, creating an instable ground for the musicians.}
