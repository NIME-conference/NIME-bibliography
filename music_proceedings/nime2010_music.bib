These sonic gestures are then mapped to performance parameters for the computer's virtual flute sonification. Of course the virtual flute doesn't have to conform to the physical constraints of the “real-world”.

  abstract = {Program notes:  This audiovisual work for acoustic instruments and interactive software uses simple models of physical structures to mediate between acoustic sounds and computer generated sound and visuals. Musicians use their acoustic instruments to playfully interact with a physically modelled virtual sound sculpture which is projected onto the screen.
The musicians use sounds produced on their acoustic instruments to reach into the virtual world and grasp, push and hit the sculpture. In response the structure glows, spins, bounces around and generates its own sounds. The pitch and timbre of the live acoustic sounds are captured and transformed by the virtual sculpture which sings back in its own way. Each individual object (or mass) in the physical model is linked to a synthesis engine which uses additive and subtractive synthesis techniques to produce a wide range of sonic textures.
The frequency of oscillators of the synthesis engines are set by the acoustic sounds played by the acoustic musicians and the volume of sound produced is controlled by the movement of the masses. The effect is that the sound sculpture produces evocative sounds clearly linked to the sonic gestures of the performers and the movement of the onscreen sculpture.
During performance the physical structure and characteristics of the sculpture are altered. Links between masses are cut, spring tension of the links
altered and damping is ramped up and down. Thus, while transparency of operation is maintained, the complexity of the interaction between the acoustic and electronic performers and the sound sculpture itself leads to rich conversational musical interactions.

About the performers:  Andrew Johnston is a musician and software developer living in Sydney, Australia. He completed a music performance degree at the Victorian College of the Arts in 1995 and has performed with several Australian symphony orchestras and a number of other ensembles.

The Computer was born in China in 2009, but eventually found its way to England to the ownership of a grubby handed computer musician. Though ostensibly based somewhere near Brighton, it went on to have many adventures around the world, and is grateful to its owner at least for never putting it in hold luggage. Though suffering an alarming logic board failure of cataclysmic proportions before even reaching its first birthday, replacement surgery by qualified though over familiar service personnel saved its life. Philosophical questions remain about the extent to which its current personality is contiguous with the old, as evidenced in various proprietary programs temporarily refusing to believe in their host brain anymore. But it is just happy it can be here tonight to play for you.

  abstract = {Program notes: "Mutations" is an interactive work exploring notions of the DJ set and the remix through the integration of various streams of piano based material in live performance. Incorporating human and machine-generated material, a “realization” of the piece involves the management of a pool of audio files, MIDI files, and score fragments, which are drawn upon during performance. In this way, the performer is required to control and shape the various streams of material in the same way that a DJ would select and combine records during the structuring of a live set (an alternative realization of `Mutations' may involve the playback of mixed material, in which the trajectory of the narrative has been determined in advance). The supply of audio files, MIDI files, and score fragments used in the construction of the piece takes existing works from the piano repertoire as source material, both transformed and quoted intact, resulting in a spectrum of recognizability ranging from the easily identifiable, to the ambiguous, to the non-referential. The integration of this borrowed material within the three strands of the piece highlights various connections between traditional forms of musical borrowing, transformative imitation, improvisation, electroacoustic sound transformation and quotation, EDM sampling practices, remix practices and DJ performance. This version of `Mutations' features a pre-recorded electronic part, realized using a software application created by Jon Weinel.

About the performers: Robert Ratcliffe is currently completing a PhD in composition (New Forms of Hybrid Musical Discourse) at Keele University (UK). He is the first composer to develop a musical language based on the cross fertilization of contemporary art music and electronic dance music (EDM). http://www.myspace.com/visionfugitive.

It plays with sonic space and non-space; the use of the grace note to define relationships of transition from a forgotten or distant space to a familiar space, a known pitch. The piece contemplates memory, the experience of snapping out of a daydream, from distant imaginings or recollections to the real space, the events right in front of you. The realtime electronic transformation makes the space fluid and introduces a height ened depth of perspective. Surround sound spatialization techniques are used also to bring the sound of the clarinet off the stage and around the audience, subverting the audience as spectator relationship to one where the audience is at the core of the work, the position the performer usually occupies.

About the performers: Garth Paine has exhibited immersive interactive environments in Australia, Europe, Japan, USA, Hong Kong and New Zealand.

We are earth people

Long have we hidden
In the rock heavy heart
And harboured our strengths
Among the agonies of stone

Ours is the granite
Wind withered to pinnacles
And the whispered secret
Passed behind its scream

And the dark slate blasted
Into fragments of its nature
Shattered forgotten bodies
Patterned random
Heaped on houses

Dropped on churches
Silenced hymns
On buried villages lost to light

We mourn our eagles
Count our sheep
Lay our seed on crusted bed spring
Spines shrunk with the gravity
Dreams pulled out of star flight
Driven back to earth to bone
To wakeful vision raw with piling rock
Against the sun

We are the subjects of a skyline
Held in hard embrace
Its dark love a sanctuary
For our healing

The poem reflects Daws' response to the altered landscape formed by slate quarrying in the village of Bethesda in North Wales.
The role of the instrumentalists in this piece is to create a textural accompaniment to the words. Through different sound transformation techniques, the sounds of the instruments are altered in real-time to create word-painting effects.
Video sequences of the poet himself are juxtaposed against images of the area in question. These images are manipulated in real-time by the sound of the instruments themselves. The video imagery, like the music, is intended to re flect the meaning of the text. For this piece, I created my own software tools in Max/MSP/Jitter for live audio/video interaction.

In the unmodified equations driving forces are introduced mathematically, however, as we calculate the chaotic systems in real-time we open the door to using a performers audio signal as an input force.
This class of oscillator exhibits interesting behavior in response to different frequency inputs; in particular, the systems are sensitive to changes in low frequency tones. This encourages the use of Just Intonation as a method of determining tuning systems with easily defined difference tones; the scale developed by Kraig Grady features many difference tones in an excitable range for the chaotic oscillators.

About the performers:
Mark Havryliv is a doctoral student developing a haptic musical instrument at the University of Wollongong. Aside from that research, he is interested in the musical possibilities of integrating real-time sonification with other disciplines like game design and creative writing.

Kraig Grady, an Anaphorian now living in Australia, composes almost exclusively for acoustic instruments of his own making or modification tuned to just intonation. Often his work is combined with his Shadow Theatre productions. His work has been presented at Ballhaus Naunyn Berlin (Germany), the Chateau de la Napoule (France), the Norton Simon Museum of Art, the UCLA Armand Hammer Museum, the Pacific Asia Museum, the Los Angeles Philharmonics American Music Weekend and New Music America 1985. He was chosen by Buzz Magazine as one of the "100 coolest people in Los Angeles".

The instrument for Strike On Stage is a large performance surface for multiple players to control computer based musical instruments and visuals.
