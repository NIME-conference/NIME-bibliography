  abstract = {The Cologne based ladies‘ quartet 120 DEN, founded in 2019, plays with modified mannequin legs, which become independent electronic instruments through guitar strings, contact microphones and built-in synthesizer elements. The resulting sounds range from subtle caresses to overflowing tapestries of sound, to knee-jerked death metal passages and conceptual electronic textures. The experimental leg sound is of course also supported orally.}

  abstract = {The khipu is an information processing and transmission device used mainly by the Inca empire and previous Andean societies. The word comes from the kichwa1 language [khipu] which means knot. This mnemotechnic interface, is one of the first textile computers known, consisting of a central wool or cotton cord to which other strings are attached with knots of different shapes, colors, and sizes encrypting different kinds of values and information. The system was widely used until the Spanish colonization that banned their use and destroyed a large number of these devices [1]. In the performance, the interface is reused as a NIME using new materials in an electronic khipu, paying homage to this device with the convert into an instrument for the interaction and generation of live experimental sound. Through the weaving of knots, the artist takes the position of a contemporary “khipukamayuq”(who was the person dedicated to knot the khipu) [3] seeking, from a decolonial perspective to encode with the touch, the gestures and the different kinds of knots, the interrupted legacy of this ancestral practice in a different experience of tangible live coding and computer music, as well as weave the past with the present of the indigenous and people resistance of the Andean territory with their sounds.}

  abstract = {Zipper Music is scored for 2 amplified zipper players with interactive electronics performed by a MIDI controller operator. It forms part of my Quotidian Music series, embodying the musicality afforded by everyday sounds, and performable by ‘everyday’ people, without requiring traditional musical training. Each zipper has a distinctive timbre, depending on material and length, as well as the fabric to which it is sewn. The zipper players are amplified and the sound of each is sent to a laptop. Next, their sound is either transformed using a MIDI controller, or sent through untouched, to stereo speakers. Coomposer Max Tfirm developed the original Max patch in consultation with me, with some additional changes by Alex Christie. The piece can be thought of as a dialogue, where the actors may be in sync or not; may try to convince one another, interrupt one another, or even talk over one another. Ultimately, they agree. The premiere performance is linked below. This version is for 2 amplified zipper players and 2 MIDI controllers and was premiered by the University of Virginia New Music Ensemble with Danielle Zevitz and Tianyu Zhang as zipper players, and Alex Christie and Travis Thatcher on MIDI controllers. The duration is 8:00, a minute longer than your requested duration; the structure was built around this time frame.}

Qin is a special symbol in Chinese culture and literature that is associated with delicacy, elegance, confidence, power, eloquence, and longing for communication. The symbol Qin appears in literature as early as the time that the Book of Songs was collected. Qin is also a Chinese instrument. Qin has been played since ancient times, and has traditionally been favored by scholars and appeared in literature as an instrument associated with the ancient Chinese philosopher Confucius. In my composition Qin, I took as inspiration the shape of the original Qin instrument and mapped some of the traditional functions on to my custom-made performance interface, replacing the traditional Qin performance techniques with newly developed techniques that draw the desired data from the controllers.}

The kinetic sculpture is a collaboration between the Aurie Hsu and sound artist, Kyle Hartzell. The sculpture integrates design elements of a violin, erhu (Chinese “spike fiddle”), and a hurdy gurdy in using motorized gears to draw a bowing mechanism across the strings. The instrument also features two sets of sympathetic strings to augment the registral range and resonance of the instrument. The various ways of playing the instrument - plucking, using a metal slide across the strings, actuating the sympathetic strings, mechanical bowing, and physically altering the bow pressure - serve as a sound source for live electronics that further expand the instrument. The duration of the piece is four and a half minutes.}

  abstract = {Split Point is a quiet ambient work which explores inclusion and constraint and the redistribution of musical processes in contemporary piano music. In a collaboration between inclusive music collective The Wired Ensemble and experimental pianist Alex Lucas, the piano is played collectively, over a network, through the use of reductionist, accessible interfaces. In this con guration, the piano is considered a hyper-instrument with parameters such as pitch, rhythm and timbre, split and redistributed amongst the group. We invite the audience to consider if it is musically interesting to split the piano in such a way and if an individual can communicate independent creative expression when using binary on-off controllers; a common goal in inclusive music.}

In a tide-locked state, it and Pluto gradually becoming synchronous rotation from different orbits and rotation rates due to the influence of tidal forces over a period of time. This work combines different sounds of Chinese instrument, Western instrument and Samples. Their process from struggle to integration is a metaphor that Charon is gradually affected by tidal forces. Technology in this work has created interaction among acoustic instruments, samples and sound effects. The connection among them develops the work. I believe that the tension and interaction are the fascination of the combination of sounds.}
