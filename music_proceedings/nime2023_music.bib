  abstract = {SPLT/SCRN is a game-piece where two improvisers play against each-other using their instruments as game controllers. The piece consists of multiple randomized mini-challenges where the performers need to improvise in order to understand what musical gestures are required from them through positive feedback from the screen. The mini-games cover a range of musical affordances, giving the advantage to both instrumentalists at different times. The instrument signal is analysed in real-time using machine learning techniques through Max/MSP, and used as control data for both the progress within the game, as well as the control of the live electronics. These parameters are then sent through OSC to the game engine Unity and control the game. In addition, the hybrid system makes use of DMX-controlled lights, which are also mapped to control data and game levels. On-screen events are accentuated through lights within the physical space, merging the physical and the digital.},

  abstract = {Our idea starts from the necessity to investigate space, explore its features, find the potential in acoustic properties, and use them as a starting point for our research. How is it possible to create a three-dimensional and analog sound system? How are we able to work with instruments that can move sound in space? Taking advantage of the use of customized industrial items, we will have the possibility to create three-dimensional audio images controlled and designed in real-time by the performers. The concept that interests us is the single percussive impulse as a music creator. We can change the surface, and speed of the execution but the impulse is at the core of every percussive action. Solenoids are our artistic medium and the interesting aspect is the relationship between us as human performers and the possibilities that arise through our interaction with a complex mechanical instrument. Thus we see in this instrument an extension of our percussive possibilities.},

  abstract = {“Chomsky Hash” is a piece for improvisation, electric guitar, and live electronics. The piece utilizes traditional guitar effects processing with a variety of unconventional effects for the instrument, along with a surround panner setup for quadraphonic sound. The laptop and electronic elements also act as improvising agent, with a variety of chance operations that allow the computer to make decisions for itself in performance. The title is a reference to the famous debate between Noam Chomsky and Michel Foucault. Famously, Foucault asked to be paid in a large amount of hash for his participation in the debate. Friends would say that on special occasions Foucault would break out “that Chomsky Hash”. The relevance of this debate to the piece is the elements I’m working with and transforming. The electric guitar itself has a long history in American popular music and has a lot of specific cultural connotations that could seem traditional even though at times it’s been a counter cultural symbol. With the use of DAW’s such as Ableton Live or Max/MSP, the electric guitar can be further altered and expanded upon. Noam Chomsky is considered a radical and countercultural figure in American politics, but within the debate with Michel Foucault comes off as traditional and conservative compared to Foucault’s Dionysian and hedonistic character traits. The debate itself is an interesting synthesis of the two thinkers' ideas. The main driving factors of the piece are improvisation, timbral transformation, live electronics processing, and spatialization. Since 2019, I’ve been working on bringing together my instrumental background as a guitarist and improviser with my interest in electronic music. This piece is a part of a series of pieces for electric guitar \& live electronics.},

Our collaboration draws on O’Rawe’s experience in art installation contexts and with electronic dance music group Not Squares, and Stapleton’s work as an instrument inventor, sound designer and improviser in groups such as Ens Ekt and 3BP. Our performance for NIME 2023 begins by asking, what kind of strange rhythmic futures will continue to be built at the intersection of Mexican and Irish cultures? To aid this endeavour, we invoke the mythology of Batallón de San Patricio, a group of disenfranchised European (largely Irish) immigrants and African slaves who defected from the United States Army to fight on the side of the Mexican Army during the Mexican-American War of 1846-48. The battalion has been memorialised by a broad range of musicians, novelists and filmmakers. These accounts provide stories of cultural resonances in the lives of diverse peoples, unlikely collectives who formed allegiances through their shared oppression at the hands of dominant imperialist powers. Our storytelling here is similar, but also different. While we are interested in resonances, allegiances, and points of connection that form moments of tense but productive co-existences between different communities, we are likewise drawn towards the precarious, noisy and uncertain material processes enacted in such meetings. Thus, we seek a kind of dissensual groove, an oscillation between distance and relation, remixing fragments from Irish and Mexican music traditions into fragile and ever-collapsing rhythmic architectures, creating spaces in which to move.},

Since all the hardware is commercially available and relatively inexpensive, this system is easy to build. Through this work, we are showing that a performance that is not bound by location is possible through a relatively inexpensive and easy-to-construct performance system. The title "Unboxing" refers to escaping from the economic, social, political, and artistic constraints of conventional performances. It also alludes to “unboxing” as an internet meme in online videos where one does not know what is contained in the box before it is opened - as the performance data and the resulting sound structures cannot be evaluated beforehand. This project aims to open up computer music creativity to a wider audience through frugal technology and escape Western-centric concepts of music and dances. As alternative, we propose the term “electronic sound performance”.},

The instrument continues the development of early models for pioneering dancer Philippa Cullen (1950-1975), expanding its use as an expressive and versatile instrument for musicians to play. The Floors use a large interactive surface for fine control of many sonic parameters with a small number of sensors. The violone is the Renaissance precursor to the double bass. It is a large instrument that has six gut strings, gut frets and is played with a viol style underhand bow. This instrument also requires the whole body to play and physically support the instrument in performance. This new work brings these two instruments together and is an interplay between the definitions of instruments and controller as they relate to contemporary practices based on gesture. Working with the specific limitations of the body in relation to large objects, the Floors and the violone both function as controllers for affecting sound and as instruments for creating sound.},

  abstract = {The Moirai Mask is an ornate mask that operates as a NIME. The mask has an integrated MIDI controller that allows the performer to play music by touching the brass and bamboo panels. In performance, the artist uses audio-montage to collage sounds of the Australian wilderness with electronics and sampled fragments of an acoustic string instrument. The mask is handmade from predominantly recycled materials; hand cut brass panels and hand painted bamboo elements adorn the front of the mask, which are sewn into the cotton paneling that covers the hand soldered electrical components. The Moirai Mask is a sonic play on the Covid-19 PPE mask. The PPE mask, like an exo-skeleton, provides an extra, augmented layer of protection from our bodies, the ‘outside world’, the virus, the Other. The Covid-19 pandemic forced us to accept our bodily limitations and embrace this prosaic form of human augmentation, the PPE mask. Furthermore, as the Covid-19 virus enters our bodies and is transmitted through our breath, we must acknowledge that we are not separate from the non-human world that we inhabit but are in fact bodily constituted through it [1]. As Deborah Lupton et al. point out ‘the COVID crisis [has] heightened awareness of our collective vulnerability to each other’s more-than-human bodies’ [ibid.]. Drawing on the concept of a NIME, here the PPE mask is appropriated as a symbolic and subversive art object, paying sonic homage to the non-human world while the artist’s voice is subtly silenced.},

  abstract = {BANDNAME is composed of three womxn NAME, NAME, and NAME and guests who use the physical properties of the electromagnetic spectrum to create installations, performances and recordings. Using electronic feedback, audio speakers, various kinds of microphones/pickups, and resonant objects of all shapes and kinds, we summon the feminine spirit of electromagnetism, aka the Goddess of the Electronic Medium aka the ElecroMagnetic Goddess. We have a flexible membership inclusive to all peoples who are willing to open themselves up to this spirit. In terms of current trends in audio technology, we invoke a feminist response to the masculinization of the music industry, audio engineering, and to the artistic spaces of sound arts in general.  Our latest project includes playing with painted score-objects Bareëmins. They are painted with conductive carbon paint, and non-conductive paint. When the area that is conductive is activated it produces sound, the non-conductive area does not. Thereby, by alternating painted and not painted areas in an aesthetic way, a score can be embedded into the very instrument itself. The paint can be applied to paintings as well as the inside of paper and plastic sculptures the results are many fold.  There are folded paper crystal Bareëmins that look like crystals suitable for an electromagnetic altar. You can use them to invoke the Electromagnetic Goddess at home.   The project is particularly aligned with this year's theme of Frugal Music Innovation as it uses all natural materials + paste glue to create the painted score/instrument. The carbon paint is made by recycling charcoal from a cooking fire, the colored paint is everyday school supplies and paint made out of found earth pigment. The binder is paste glue. The brains are an Arduino running simple theremin code with only 2 resistors and an 8ohm speaker as peripherals.   video here   https://youtu.be/YAD-F68Ntl4},

  abstract = {Sonic Swells is a multimedia music composition for fixed audio, filmed footage of a surfer and live saxophone. This iterative sound art project explores the use of sonification of ocean weather data, sonification of movement data from a surfer riding waves, and live performance as tools for music composition. Weather data is collected through a free API and converted to sound in Max/MSP, driving the parameters of a very large additive and subtractive synthesizer that uses pink noise as its fundamental sound source. The sonification includes swell direction and wind speed that dictate the positions of audio in the stereo or surround speaker field, and wave height and swell period driving an undulating filter effect. The severity of the conditions dictates the complexity of the soundscape. Sampled audio is blended into the sonification. The surfer's movement data is collected with a DIY kit including an iPhone for telemetry, an android or esp32 watch for data logging, and a small Wi-Fi router with battery and a GoPro. This information influences elements of the ocean weather sonification and affects the saxophone live performance. The performer plays a combination of scored and improvised material. The piece explores the relationship between sonification, motion and music.},

  abstract = {Absence is a performance for audio–visual concatenative synthesis elaborated during Diemo Schwarz’s art–science residency at the IMéRA Institute for Advanced Study in 2022. It explores several notions of absence: of light, of love, of humanity, where societies and all human artefacts will be destructured to gradually disappear within the materials and textures of the natural world. Audio–visual concatenative synthesis extends the principle of corpus-based sound synthesis to the visual domain, where, in addition to the sound corpus (i.e. a collection of segments of recorded sound with a perceptual description of their sound character), the artist uses a corpus of still images with perceptual description (colour, texture, brightness, entropy, and other content-based image descriptors). The artist then creates an audio–visual musical performance by navigating through one of these descriptor spaces, e.g. through the collection of sound grains in a space of perceptual audio descriptors, and at the same time through the other descriptor space, i.e. select images from the visual corpus for rendering, and thus navigate in parallel through both corpora interactively with gestural control via movement sensors. This will evoke an aesthetic of acoustic and visual collage or cut-up, generating an audio–visual sequence of similar sounds/images from the two corpora when navigation is local, and opposing contrasting sounds/images when the navigation jumps to different parts of the linked sound/image descriptor space. The artistic–technological question that is explored here is how to control at the same time the navigation through the audio and the image descriptor spaces with gesture sensors, i.e. how to link the gesture sensing to both the image descriptors and the sound descriptors in order to create a multi-modal audio–visual performance.},

The piece uses the TidalCycles language alongside a tool we developed called SHARP, which provides an interactive, tree-like structure embedded in the text editor to track how blocks of code evolve over time. SHARP opens up new musical affordances centered around quickly switching between previous program states. In addition, SHARP’s version trees act as a kind of post-hoc score, leaving a visual trace of the piece’s structure as it unfolds. With Branch, we attempt to go beyond a simple demonstration of SHARP as a tool and instead create a piece which highlights the interplay between musical form, its visual representation in SHARP, and the sonic material itself. To that end, Branch makes use of machine-generated speech based mostly on snippets from the text of Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken”. The text is largely decontextualized, and its treatment is somewhat tongue-in-cheek: while the poem’s premise centers around not being able to take both paths, we can easily explore as many code paths as we wish. In addition to speech, Branch uses audio samples from Freesound, including the sounds of twigs snapping, knocking on wood, and a person stepping on leaves.},

The work alludes to principles of the live coding practice as its performance happens in an improvised way through editing and running a pre-prepared computer code that controls the processes for music and video generation. The code is displayed as the top layer of the video, making available to the audience the performer’s decisions, as well as the algorithmic structure of the work, and having an aesthetic role as part of the visual composition of the work.},

By introducing this form of input, our improvisational performance will challenge the traditional approach to live performance by creating a closed loop between our emotions and the performance itself. In a sense, we will be improvising with our own presence. We believe this new kind of performative dialogue can challenge existing hierarchies within live music performances. This novel performance paradigm seeks to examine new performative dialogues and ideas on what it means to perform live. Current performance practices are often based predominantly on the direct communication of the performers through their respective instruments. When we introduce the performer’s physiology as a gestural language, we hope to define a new methodology of presence-based improvisation. The performers wear custom built sensing wristbands and elastic breathing bands around their chest to gather physiological data consisting of EDA (electrodermal activity), HRV (heart rate variability), and respiration rate. This data is then sent via OSC to a laptop running Max/MSP which applies this live data to the robotic koto and the Eurorack system. These data streams and occurrences of synchrony between the performers’ data are then sonified and used as a structural indicator of the current state of the performers, thereby forming a new unspoken dialogue between the two.},

Our group consists of five highly experienced music improvisers, visual artists and instrument makers with a shared connection to the Sonic Arts Research Centre (SARC) at Queen’s University Belfast.   Performer-makers in this group have multiple decades of experience producing work in academic and professional contexts in Europe, the Americas and the Middle East [websites anonymised, but available upon request].  We are particularly interested in exploiting irregularities in the qualities of circuit components (e.g. imprecise tolerances/values), and how this allows for the development of stylistic differences across multiple instrument-performer configurations. We are also interested in how skill, style and performance techniques are developed in different ways on similar devices over extended periods of time, and how our existing musical practices are reconfigured through such collaborative exchanges.   For this musical performance each performer will use DIY EMI featuring function generators and wide band noise. The instruments are ‘bent by design’ (Hordijk 2009) and use ‘withered technologies’(Ott 2020) at their core. These musical instruments have been selected to promote productive instability whilst building a timbral playground.   The DIY instrument ethos includes the publication of the designs and ‘how to’ instructions to assist other makers in the creation of their own EMI, especially those who have to adopt a frugal approach to resources.  The aesthetic of our performance is informed by noise and free improvised musics, and is offered as continuation of ‘thinkering’ (Huhtamo 2011) practice as part of the history of electronic music experimentation.},

  abstract = {4 Disklavier Preludes is one of the main works in The Gedanken Room (2021). This is a work that explores the implications of Quantum Computing for Music composition, both conceptually and practically. Its 4 parts explore the use of the Disklavier both as an input and output interface for building Quantum Circuits and retrieving its measurements, in a live interactive multimedia environment with which live performers interact. The cinematographic narrative addresses utopian/dystopian issues in human-machine interaction.},

  abstract = {Finger Breath, for performer, live electronics, and zither, was originally commissioned by the the Frontside International Chamber Music Festival, funded by a grant from the Swedish Arts Council, and premiered in January 2023 as a headphone performance in the belly of a small passenger ferry. The main concepts behind the work are three: First, the intimate sounds from the musicians breathing, and from his fingers on the strings of an ancient zither. Second, the idea that the live breathing and the musician’s sounds played by finger movements are the only sources of gestural control and expression in the piece. Breathing and finger movements form the basis of many musical expressions throughout the world, as they are our most intimate physiological and gestural bodily mechanisms. Third, the combination of the first two into a situation of  “entangled musicianship”, where each action has triple consequences: as a sound source to be heard live, as a sound source being fed to various buffers for later manipulation and playback, but also as a source of gestural control, affecting a variety of playback mechanisms for the buffered sounds. It is thus impossible to play something without also altering the conditions for future playing. Hence the entanglement.},
