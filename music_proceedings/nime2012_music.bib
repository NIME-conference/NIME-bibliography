The piece \emph{Floating Points II} is the result of the continued work of the instrument makers and performers Michael Vierling and Matthias Schneiderbanger within their self-developed system for collaborative performance including the digital musical instruments Sensor-table and Chirotron. These instruments use several sensors to transform the movements and gestures of their players into data for sound generation, placement and movement of the sound in the room.

The performances with \emph{Sensor-table} and \emph{Chirotron} emphasize the connection between the performer and the digital musical instruments by using the basic noise of the sensors as a notable characteristic in the sound synthesis to accentuate the technical boundaries in an aesthetic way. The network is the core of the common setup: It offers the ability to connect two physically separated instruments into one common signal chain for sound processing and spatialisation.

Water Birds is an interactive and collaborative composition for clarinet, bass clarinet and computer. The sound of the clarinets is processed live by spectral delays with MaxMSP and rtcmix~. Space structures the composition, as the particular sound parameters initiated depend on the performer's location on the stage. The development of the current version of the piece involved a custom wireless infrared sensor network, which responds to the clarinetist's movements. Currently the piece is performed without the sensor network, but the strategy of that configuration still drives the composition. A score containing five sound-generating ideas, consisting of musical fragments and a Zen poem, allows the performer to improvise, creating his/her own sound pathway through the piece. The pathway is reminiscent of the path of birds in the Zen poem, Dogen's \emph{On the Nondependence of Mind}, which reads: ``Water birds/going and coming/their traces disappear/but they never/forget their path.''

Adam \& Atau exploit a commonly available consumer electronics device, a smartphone, as an expressive, gestural musical instrument. The device is well known an iconic object of desire in our society of consumption, playing music as a fixed commodity. The performers re-appropriate the mobile phone and transform the consumer object into an instrument for concert performance. As a duo, with one in each hand, they create a chamber music, 4-hands iPhone. The accelerometers allow high precision capture of the performer's free space gestures. This drives a granular synthesis patch in Pure Data (PD), where one patch becomes the process by which a range of sounds from the natural world are stretched, frozen, scattered, and restitched. The fact that all system components---sensor input, signal processing and sound synthesis, and audio output, are embodied in a single device make it a self-contained, expressive musical instrument.

\emph{Aphasia} (2010), for solo performer and two-channel tape, was commissioned by the GRM, Paris and composed for virtuoso singer Nicholas Isherwood. The tape, an idiosyncratic explosion of warped and mangled sounds, is made up exclusively of vocal samples---all provided by Isherwood and subsequently transformed digitally.  Against the backdrop of this audio narrative, an elaborate set of hand gestures are performed---an assiduously choreographed sign language of sorts.  Each gesture is fastidiously synchronized to the tape in tight rhythmic coordination.

In the context of NIME, the piece is noteworthy for its deliberate---if unintentionally political---contemporary technology abstinence.  Ancillary questions arise, such as ``What are the present limits of gesture control?''; ``Do these limitations present unwelcome pressures on the boundaries of artistic imagination and creative capacity?''; and ``How do we learn to recognize when it is artistically prudent to eschew emerging tools?''

Two typical NIME related inventions meet in this performance. IRCAM based Diemo Schwarz and HKU lecturer and Electrumpet player Hans Leeuw met at STEIM in 2010. The extreme sound possibilities of the sensor driven Electrumpet combine wonderfully with the corpus based techniques in CataRT. Both Diemo and Hans play their self-invented instruments for a number of years in which they have done several iterations / extensions and built a lot of performance experience. This experience pays off in the expressive capabilities of both performers making this a concert that goes far beyond an extended demonstration of new instruments. In \emph{Violent Dreams}, Hans's manipulated sounds are recorded in CataRT, from which Diemo chooses specific sonic characters and evolutions via gestural controllers, that are played back and transformed by CataRT, challenging Hans to come up with more extreme sounds surpassing his own originals. Thus we get an interesting and challenging improvisation battle between two players that both fully master their instrument.

Hans Leeuw (Electrumpet), Diemo Schwarz (CataRT, gestural controllers)

Artist(s) Biography:

Hans Leeuw is recognized as one of Hollands top players composers and bandleaders in the Jazz and improvised music scene even before he started to use electronics and designed his own Electrumpet. He is most noted as the bandleader of the Dutch formation Tetzepi, a 14 piece Big Band. Tetzepi exists for 15 years and is structurally funded by Dutch government.
Next to his activities as a performer Hans teaches at the Utrecht school for the arts at the Music Technology department and at the faculty Industrial Design of the Technical University Eindhoven where he coaches projects on the design of new musical instruments.
In 2008 he designed the Electrumpet, a hybrid electroacoustic instrument that differs from similar design in that it takes the trumpet players normal playing position and expression in account thus creating an instrument that combines acoustic and electronic expression seamlessly. (see `the electrumpet, additions and revisions')

Diemo Schwarz is a researcher and developer at Ircam, composer of electronic music, and musician on drums and laptop.  He holds a PhD in computer science applied to music for his research on corpus-based concatenative musical sound synthesis.
His compositions and live performances, under the name of his solo project Mean Time Between Failure, or improvising with musicians such as Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Blondy, Victoria Johnson, Pierre Alexandre Tremblay, Etienne Brunet, Luka Juhart, George Lewis, Evan Parker, explore the possibilities of corpus-based concatenative synthesis to re-contextualise any sound source by rearranging sound units into a new musical framework using interactive navigation through a sound space, controlled by gestural input devices.
His research work includes improving interaction between musician and computer, and exploiting large masses of sound for interactive real-time sound synthesis, collaborating with composers such as Philippe Manoury, Dai Fujikura, Stefano Gervasoni, Aaron Einbond, Sam Britton.

\emph{the ellipsis catalog} features new instruments designed by Kevin Patton and Butch Rovan. Patton's instrument, the ``Fossil'', is a wireless sensor-based musical instrument that is played with the entire gestural range of arm movement as well as finger pressure. Four FSRs, a momentary button, and a two-dimensional accelerometer are used to control the parameters of a custom software environment built in Max/MSP/Jitter. It is part of a group of four hand-carved wood instruments called the Digital Poplar Consort.

Rovan's ``Banshee'' is an analog electronic musical instrument. Modeled after a wind instrument, the design uses six finger pads to control the pitch of an array of interrelated oscillators, and a mouth sensor that allows the performer to control volume. The Banshee also features a tilt-sensor that allows motion to change the voicing circuitry and resulting timbre. Battery powered, the instrument can plug into any amplifier or mixing console, much like an electric guitar.

\emph{Clarinet} is the third piece in a series of monotimbral works.  Like its siblings \emph{Piano} and \emph{Cymbal}, it was inspired by the sound qualities of an acoustic instrument. This minimalist and meditative piece is a structured improvisation performed on the sponge, a musical interface designed by the composer. The sponge is basically a cushion equipped with sensors (accelerometers, buttons and force sensing resistors) which detect when it is squeezed, twisted or shaken.  Because the sponge evolves continuously, the piece exists in many versions.  Each new version drifts further away from the original compositional intentions and the piece is slowly becoming less meditative.  The latest version is subtitled Albino Butterfly.

Artist(s) Biography:

Martin Marier is a composer and a performer who is mainly interested in live electronic music using new interfaces.  He is the inventor of the sponge, a cushion like musical interface that he uses to perform his pieces.  The main goal of this approach is to establish a natural link between gesture and sound in electronic music.  He aims at improving the interaction with the audience and at making the process of composing more playful.  His research on the sponge is the topic of the doctorate he is pursuing at the Universit de Montral under the supervision of Prof. Jean Pich\'{e}.  He was also supervised by Dr. Garth Paine during an exchange at the University of Western Sydney (Australia) in 2011.
Martin has also composed music for theatre, collaborating mostly with the Th\'{e}\^{a}tre I.N.K. company for whom he wrote the music of three plays: "L'effet du temps sur Mat\'{e}vina" (2012), "Roche, papier... couteau" (2007), "La cadette" (2006).  He sometimes writes music for films and collaborates with the film composer Benoit Charest. He is one of the founders of Point d'\'{e}coute (PDE), a collective whose purpose is to promote electroacoustic music.  Along with his four colleagues of PDE, he produced concerts in Montreal, New York and Sydney.

\emph{Music for Sleeping \& Waking Minds} (2011-2012) is an overnight event in which four performers fall asleep while wearing custom designed EEG sensors, which monitor their brainwave activity over the course of one night. The data gathered from the EEG sensors is applied in real time to different audio and image signal processing functions, resulting in a continuously evolving multi-channel sound environment and visual projection. This material serves as an audiovisual description of the individual and collective neurophysiological state of the ensemble, with sounds and images evolving according to changes in brainwave activity. Audiences, who are invited to bring anything that they need to ensure comfortable sleep, can experience the work in different states of attention: while alert and sleeping, resting and awakening.

Artist(s) Biography:

Gascia Ouzounian is a violinist, musicologist, and composer. She has performed with such varied ensembles as Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble at Carnegie Hall, Bang On A Can All-Stars at the Mass MOCA, Sinfonia Toronto at the Toronto Centre for the Arts, and the Theatre of Eternal Music Strings Ensemble at the Dream House. Gascia's recent projects include two compositions that are intended for overnight listening: EDEN EDEN EDEN with filmmaker Chloe Griffin, and \emph{Music for Sleeping \& Waking Minds} with R. Benjamin Knapp, Eric Lyon and R. Luke DuBois. In the latter, an ensemble of sleeping performers generates an audiovisual environment through their neurophysiological activity over the course of one night. Gascia teaches at Queen's University Belfast, where she leads the performance programme in the School of Creative Arts. Her writings on experimental music and sound art appear in numerous academic journals and the book \emph{Paul DeMarinis: Buried in Noise.}

R. Benjamin Knapp is the founding director of the Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology at Virginia Tech, where he is Professor of Computer Science. Ben has led the Music, Sensors and Emotion (MuSE) group, whose research focuses on the understanding and measurement of the physical gestures and emotional states of musical performers and their audience. For over 20 years, Ben has been researching and developing user-interfaces and software that enable composers and performers to augment the physical control of a musical instrument with more direct neural interaction. From the invention of the Biomuse with Hugh Lusted in 1987 to the introduction of the concept of an Integral Music Controller (a generic class of controllers that use the direct measurement of motion and emotion to augment traditional methods of musical instrument control) in 2005, Ben has focused on creating a user-aware interface based on the acquisition and real-time analysis of biometric signals.

Eric Lyon is a composer and computer music researcher. During the 1980s and 1990s, his fixed media computer music focused on spectral and algorithmic processing of audio, with a tendency toward extreme modifications of samples, variously sourced. From the early 1990s, Lyon became involved with live computer music, performing solo, and in the Japanese band Psychedelic Bumpo, with the Kyma system. Later in the 1990s, he gravitated toward software-based live processing, starting to develop Max/MSP externals in 1999. This work resulted in his LyonPotpourri collection of Max/MSP externals, and the FFTease spectral package, developed in collaboration with Christopher Penrose. In recent years, Lyon has focused on computer chamber music, which integrates live, iterative DSP strategies into the creation of traditionally notated instrumental scores. Other interests include spatial orchestration, and articulated noise composition. Lyon teaches computer music in the School of Music and Sonic Art at Queen's University Belfast.

R. Luke DuBois is a composer, artist, and performer who explores the temporal, verbal, and visual structures of cultural and personal ephemera. He has collaborated on interactive performance, installation, and music production work with many artists and organizations including Toni Dove, Matthew Ritchie, Todd Reynolds, Jamie Jewett, Bora Yoon, Michael Joaquin Grey, Elliott Sharp, Michael Gordon, Maya Lin, Bang on a Can, Engine27, Harvestworks, and LEMUR, and was the director of the Princeton Laptop Orchestra for its 2007 season. Stemming from his investigations of ``time-lapse phonography,'' his recent work is a sonic and encyclopedic relative to time-lapse photography. Just as a long camera exposure fuses motion into a single image, his work reveals the average sonority, visual language, and vocabulary in music, film, text, or cultural information. He teaches at the Brooklyn Experimental Media Center at the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, and is on the Board of Directors of Issue Project Room.

\emph{Of Dust and Sand} uses the Electromagnetically-Prepared Piano device, a rack of 12 electromagnets which is suspended over the strings of a piano. Each electromagnet is sent an audio signal and in turn excites its respective string, much like a stereo speaker made from piano strings. In this piece a subset of the magnets remains active throughout, the performer physically silencing the strings by pressing down with fingertips. Thus the instrument becomes a kind of anti-piano---lifting a finger frees a string to vibrate, producing sound. In addition, various items, such as paper and a plastic ruler, rest directly on the strings further altering the timbre. Remember---everything you hear is entirely acoustic.

Of Dust and Sand is dedicated to The Kenners.

\emph{Jack Walk} explores notions of ecstatic energy, control and release. The work begins with live and fixed percussion lines, re-processed into a series of electronic representations of specified structure. This provides a compositional framework that a percussionist interacts with, while in another sonic layer, a laptop musician simultaneously samples and re-processes the live percussion while channeling the audio back into the larger environment. A videographer mixes imagery related to the original compositional notions of ecstatic control and release. Layers of sonic material emanating from the drummer's kit blur the virtual and real, while the music and imagery evoke imaginary lines tracing physical and conceptual flows of energy. The trio of performers for the NIME 2012 performance of \emph{Jack Walk} (Deal, Drews, and Munson) comprise group known as Big Robot, an Indianapolis-based computer-acoustic trio that creates live, interactive, and media-enriched works.

\emph{Desamor I} is inspired in a model of meditation where primordial awareness or naturally occurring timeless awareness is seen as a result of a conversation with my wife Alejandra. This work is for piano, computer and two Wii controllers attached to my forearms. The output is 4 channels. The gestures of the pianist (movement, timber and dynamics) are captured in real time via 2 microphones and a set of 2 Wii controllers. The computer languages involved in the development of the project were: Escamol, a prolog environment for algorithmic composition designed by the composer, and SuperCollider. In this piece I share my experience as a performer-composer within a multi-platform programming environments involving signal processing and machine learning techniques.

\emph{Flue} is a structured audio-visual improvisation for three musicians, utilizing live acoustic and electronic sound and interactive animations. A physics-based smoke simulation is influenced by the real-time audio from the musicians' performance. The audio from the performance is analyzed; high-level tempo, spectral and other features are extracted, and sent via Open Sound Control to the animation environment. The smoke trails are also able to coalesce into well- defined symbols and forms, all while moving in a natural-seeming manner consistent with the underlying fluid simulation.

The most impressive uses of the theremin cello during Theremin's time in New York are Leopold Stokowski's inclusion of one in the Philadelphia Orchestra's low string section and Varese's composition of two solo parts in Ecuatorial.  Even more important, from my perspective, is the fact that the instrument represents the first attempt to harness the human potential to shape and manipulate electronic sound by means of the technical apparatus of the modern player of bowed string instruments.

Rachmaninoff's Vocalise, Op. 34 no. 14, for textless high voice, highlights the hauntingly vocal quality of the theremin cello. Vocalise is the last of a set of 14 songs published in 1912, less than a decade before Theremin's experiments with musical sounds began to bear fruit.

Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, by virtue of their use of Bob Whitsell's Electro-Theremin on several recordings, are irrevocably linked to the history of the theremin.

The MiND Ensemble (Music in Neural Dimensions) is a new-media performance group that utilizes custom interfaces to explore the mind-machine-music connection. The traditional realization of the creative process ahs been as follows: there is an artist, a thought process, and a fixed medium which actualizes those thoughts. Neurofeedback radically shifts this paradigm. Now there is an artist and a dynamic medium that actively interfaces with the thought processes of the artist himself, drastically reshaping the way we understand the creative process. The MiND Ensemble promotes a rich awareness in which the mind is the creative medium. All projection and audio processing in this piece are driven in real time, with data gathered from the Emotiv EPOC headset.

\emph{Where Are You Standing?} (2012) is a collaborative mobile music piece using the digital compass on mobile phones as an intuitive, interactive musical instrument. The piece features performers on stage making sound by aiming at other performers: compass-measured orientation of each aiming gesture is mapped to a specific musical note depending on which player is aimed at, and is visualized on screen in real-time.

The piece begins with three performers playing ``harmonic'' sounds by taking aim at each other. This consonance is broken by the introduction of the fourth performer who represents conflict: the notes played by this performer as well as the notes played by others when they aim at this performer are dissonant to cause musical tension. Finally, the last performer leaves the stage to resolve the tension, and the piece ends with three performers back in congruity.

An improvised performance on a custom built instrument, using a simple pencil drawing as a gestural interface for controlling complex analog synthesis. The interface works by using the resistive properties of carbon to create a voltage potential field in the graphite/pencil markings on the paper using custom movable electrodes, made from coins. Then, control voltages are extracted from other points on the paper, controlling various aspects of the synthesized sound. The design was inspired by my previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is very lo-tech, easy to build, and should be possible to use with any analogue modular synthesizer. Here, I use it with a Bugbrand modular, built by Tom Bugs in Bristol, UK. The interface is presented in more detail in a paper presentation at the NIME conference.

Many of the discourses around technological development in music are deeply concerned with aspects of control; i.e. how does one exert their control, or ``mastery'' over the technology they use. However, we propose that technological systems with a certain amount of unpredictability and randomness may also be useful, especially for improvisation. As an improvisation duo, our method often involves designing electronic instruments whose behaviors are somewhat unpredictable. As a result, our entire aesthetic is largely based on ``riding'' the boundary of control. Working in this way creates a situation where we are often forced to react to, and work with, the unexpected.

Our improvisation features a number of handmade and hacked electronic instruments, all of which have been designed to behave somewhat unpredictably.

This work merges sound and light to illuminate complex rhythmic motives, polyrhythms and metrical patterns in a visual display generated by three drummers playing six ``light'' drums. These new instruments bring to life the dreams of 20th century synesthetes, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Alexander Scriabin and others who sought to create an imagined ``visual music,'' an ideal synthesis of music and visual art.

Community Light Beacons are percussion instruments that leverage the potentials of music, analog technology, and human-generated power to visualize sound. These instruments add the dimension of light to the ancient tradition of drumming. The drums are user-powered, and when they are played---banged, hit and tapped---the vibrations from the drumhead are converted to electricity by the internal speaker transducer. The generated energy powers ultra bright LEDs, which light up with every hit and beam out from the Fresnel lens.

\emph{InHands}, an audiovisual real-time improvisation for mobile phones, explores alternative options for musical interactions with two mobile instruments in live performances. In this improvisation piece, sound output of each mobile phone instrument becomes a sound input for the other instrument; to be processed further with an act of responding immediately and spontaneously. Granular synthesis module captures audio in real-time and creates the grains based on the texture of the sounds. Magnitude, roll and pitch values of the acceleration are mapped to the control parameters.  In the control layer of Sub-synthesis module, the change in direction of a touch position is tracked on the mobile surface and the distance of the same touch position to 4 certain points on the touchscreen is used as a source for creating frequency values. This mapping model generates 4 control parameters throughout 2 dimensional input layers. Hannah Drayson created the abstract visual-layers of this piece.

When designing my new electronic instruments, I always keep in mind the relationship between the instrument and performer as a tool and its master. The instrument should be a channel by which the performer can access the dimensions of sound in order to attempt to make music. The music should then originate from the musicians intention and not the instrument itself. Thus, I design my instruments as intuitive, transparent, and non-idiosyncratic mappings between physical gesture and sound.

This new electronic instrument remaps a Logitech Attack 3 Joystick to be able to control sound. Through the joystick, the performer can control volume, rhythm, repetition, and pitch of custom, preprogrammed sounds. Additionally, the joystick can be used to record and playback short audio loops. The product of this design allows for agile and intentional electronic musical gestures where rhythm, volume, and pitch are clear and deliberate. I have been able to reach a wide range of musical expressions and I am learning and discovering more as I practice MODIFIED ATTACK.

\emph{Fragments} is an improvisational performance piece that utilizes physical treatments inside an acoustic piano, as well as digital treatments provided by computer-based digital signal processing. In addition to using a few simple physical controls (foot pedals and custom iPad interface) this piece also uses the performed audio stream as a gestural control source. The preformed audio stream is analyzed and important features are extracted. The current state and trajectory of these audio features are used to influence the behavior of the real-time signal processing environment. This creates a computer-mediated performance system that combines the capabilities of computation and sound processing with the tactile and expressive intimacy of the prepared acoustic piano. \emph{Fragments} invites the listener into a unique and complex sonic environment where expectation, repetition, spontaneity, and discovery are intertwined.

In this piece we explore the personality of the ``post-modern man''. Exposed to aggressive stimulation and overwhelming data streams, he must make important choices to follow a rational ``mind path'' while his time quickly runs out. The performer, impersonating the post-modern man, wears an electro-encephalographic headset that detects his mind activity. The analysis of its output reveals the power of the performer's three thoughts which are connected to forward movement, turn left, and turn right in the virtual maze projected on a screen.

Despite the distracting external forces, embodied by the sound and flickering visuals, the performer must remain paradoxically calm to generate the correct states of mind that let him navigate his way out of the maze. Every time the performer crosses a red boundary in the maze, he gets closer to the exit, and a new stochastic musical scene is triggered. The time and structure of the composition is thus entirely determined by the choices and concentration of the performer.

\emph{M\aa ne Havn (mounhoun)} is an improvisational multi-media performance system for extended vibraphone with accompanying custom LED sculptures and projected visuals. The music draws specifically from NYC free jazz, the funeral music of the Lobi people of northern Ghana, Dub, psych rock and minimalism. Abstract interactive light sculptures actuated from the instrument's audio and controller data will accompany the performance, creating a visually shifting immersive space. The sculptures, named `Takete' and `Maluma', reference Gestalt psychology and the known correlation between our perceptions of sound and light. Mappings will reflect this phenomenon. The piece uses a pitched percussion tool suite developed by the Music Intelligence \& Sound Technology Collective at the University of Victoria, including: Magic Eyes (3D gesture controller), Ghost Hands (control data looper), MSTR DRMMR++ (rhythm template as control switches), Fantom Faders (vibraphone bars as control faders) and Gyil Gourd (physical modeling of the Lobi xylophone's gourd resonator).

In this piece, I return to my explorations of the potential of the Wii\texttrademark remote to control computer music in performance. This time, I tried to treat the physical gesture as the germ or motive for the music. Some of the gestures are abstract, but some are suggestive of familiar activities like petting a cat, ringing a bell, smoothing wallpaper , playing a guiro, scooping, tapping, or vigorous stirring.

Mimi, designed by Alexandre Fran\c{c}ois with input from Elaine Chew and Isaac Schankler, is a multi-modal interactive musical improvisation system that explores the impact of visual feedback in performer-machine interaction. The Mimi system enables the performer to experiment with a unique blend of improvisation-like on-the-fly invention, composition-like planning and choreography, and expressive performance. Mimi's improvisations are created through a factor oracle. The visual interface gives the performer and the audience instantaneous and continuous information on the state of the oracle, its recombination strategy, the music to come, and that recently played. The performer controls when the system starts, stops, and learns, the playback volume, and the recombination rate. Mimi is not only an effective improvisation partner, it also provides a platform through which to interrogate the mental models necessary for successful improvisation. This performance also features custom synths and mechanisms for inter-oracle interaction created for Mimi by Isaac Schankler.

\emph{The Theremin Orchestra} is a composition for three voices and a modular system of four spheres with built-in Theremin Sensors. Two of those spheres will control different effects on the voices and the rest will be played as Theremin instruments. The performance is presented as a sound event where initially the three voices appear raw and naked and as the composition unfolds the voices will be increasingly distorted through different effects applied with the Theremin controllers. In the climax of its progression the other two Theremin balls will become audible merging their sound with the mesh of vocal reshaped sources, not allowing to distinguish where the human ends and the machine starts.

Artist(s) Biography:

Merche Blasco: Trained as a Telecommunications Engineer, \textbf{Merche Blasco} developed in parallel to her studies a more creative path related with music, video, installation and performance. She created her alter ego ``Burbuja'' as a vehicle for her own musical exploration and since its conception she has participated \& collaborated with various artists, establishing a strong relationship between different mediums of artistic expression  \& her own musical direction lsuch as Lucy Orta at the Venice biennale, Chicks on Speed and Cristian Vogel.
Her debut,``burbuja'' (station55 records) was presented in Sonar 2007 and has been touring in different cities in Europe, USA and Canada in the past years: Mapping Festival (Geneve), Sonic Art Circuits (Washington), Queens Museum of Art (New York). Thanks to a Fulbright Grant she is currently a MPS Candidate in the Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU) where she is mainly researching about new tools for Electronic Music Performance.

Thessia Machado, Brazil/NY, investigates the physicality of sound and its effect on our perception of space. Many of her recent sculptures and installations function also as unorthodox instruments---pieces that have a real-time, live component. The expressive potential is active and changeable as the viewer interacts and performs with it. Thessia's installations and video pieces have been exhibited in New York, London, Philadelphia, Paris, Amsterdam, Dublin, Berlin and Athens.
She has been awarded residencies at the MacDowell Colony, Yaddo, the Atlantic Center for the Arts, the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the Vermont Studio Center and she is a recipient of fellowships from the New York Foundation for the Arts, The Experimental Television Center and The Bronx Museum. Performing as link, Thessia Machado, a self-avowed noisician, employs a changing line-up of handmade, found and modified instruments to build driving, meditative soundscapes.

Sonia Megias was born on June 20th 1982 in Almansa, a village at the southeast of Spain. Since she was a kid, she has been abducted by the arts, nature and spirituality. Even today, some years later, she tries to interweave these beautiful disciplines, with the goal of transmit to the world her perception of Beauty or True.
Thanks to the intensity of her musical production, she finds herself living in New York since 2010, on the Fulbright and a NYU Steinhardt grants. Here, she combines her studies at the New York University with the compositions of her last commissioned pieces.
Her music has been performed in different music halls and festivals, underlining the following: Auditorio 400 at the National Museum of Contemporary Art ``Queen Sophia'' (2012, 2008); Cervantes Institute of New York (2012, 2011); Houston University, at Opera Vista Festival (2011); Consulate of Argentina in New York, at a Tribute to Alfonsina Storni (2009); Embassy of France in Spain (2009); United Nations Headquarters (2008).

\emph{Stelaextraction} uses the electronic extension capabilities of the Yerbanaut to construct a musical composition through self-reference across different timescales. The Yerbanaut is a custom electro-acoustic kalimba built from a yerba mate gourd, with the tines placed in a circular pattern rather than the usual horizontal arrangement. Its sensors are intended to make use of this new arrangement, with force-sensitive buttons giving the otherwise inert left hand expressive capabilities, and a distance sensor allowing the right hand's motion to determine aspects of the processing. In Stelaextraction, all acoustic and processed sounds are recorded to a single buffer, the contents of which can be scrubbed through using the right hand's distance sensor. In this way, past musical gestures can be explored and then re-explored, with the recursive processing developing self-similar musical patterns over the course of the piece.

\emph{Fieldwork} is a software environment for improvised performance with electronic sound and animation. Two musicians' sounding performances are fed into the system, and analyzed for pitch, rhythm, and timbral change. When the software recognizes a sharp contrast in one performer's textures or gestures, it reflects this change by transforming the sound of the other musician's performance. Not only are the musicians responding to one another as in conventional improvisation, but they are also able to directly modify their duo partner's sound through the software. Fieldwork emphasizes rapid, glitchy, and polyrhythmic distortions of the musician's performances, and establishes unpredictable feedback processes that encourage unexpected improvisational relationships between the performers and computer.

This performance aims to approach the next style of ``mashup'' and/or ``Cut-up'' via fusion of paradigms of artificial-life and turntable. We developed a system named ``SoniCell'' to realize it. SoniCell employs four robots called ``cell''. Each cell behaves as a metaphor of life based on a simple interaction model with prey-predator relationship. Each cell is assigned a music-track in the manner of turntable. Therefore, the system reconstructs and mixes the music-tracks via cells' interactions and performers' interventions. In this framework, the aspects of the system and performers interactions and cells' internal-states create structures of sounds and music from different tracks.

\emph{DaisyLab} is a duet performance for two new interfaces for musical expression that have in common the ability to generate versatile vocal material. Diemo Schwarz's instrument uses a variety of sensors on the top of corpus-based concatenative synthesis, which has been fed with voice sounds for this performance. Nicolas d'Alessandro plays the HandSketch interface over the new MAGE speech synthesizer, bringing tangible inputs to an emerging speech synthesis technique. Both systems have been submitted as long papers for this 2012 edition of NIME. Together these two performers explore the boundaries between vocal and non-vocal sonic spaces, aiming at deconstructing the humankind's most ubiquitous communicative channel through a compositionally directed improvisation, a ``comprovisation.''
