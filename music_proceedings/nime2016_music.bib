  abstract = {Program notes: Coral Bells explores the diverse overtone, microtone sounds and origins of the Federation Hand Bells and Bass clarinet into the visual with discrete sounds of the ecosystems of coral from Fitzroy Island Northern Australia. This creation brings a new life to the Federation Hand Bells providing deepening connections with the Australian landscape. It is the conversation of between the audio and dead coral from that accentuates the audio-visual reflecting both the translucent Federation Bell sounds, Bass clarinet, glass and dead coral. The acoustic resonators vibrates with the coral and are recreated into visuals of moving glass objects. These sounds transform into acousmatic sounds. The colors and texture within the visuals are layered white/grey, sepia, hints of pastel colours, burnt reds, yellows and gold images that are layered to create a thick timbral texture to form the video voice. The sounds of subtle high pitched Bells and gritty sand sounds with the Bass clarinet periodically joining the drones with discordant multiphonics and flourishes of notes dominate throughout. Subsequent acoustic and visual motifs capture and emerge sonically/visually creating timbre layers of the interpreted coral and glass reflections.}

  abstract = {Program notes: Working almost exclusively at a very soft volume, Shelter inverts the relationships between the source sound material and it’s experience in the real world, placing very large sounds (sourced from field recordings) at the threshold of audibility while audio artifacts are brought to the forefront of our focus to act as recognisable musical material. By utilising a soft dynamic, all audience members are able to hear each channel more equally, regardless of their position in the performance space. This new version for bass clarinet, electric guitar, and electronics expands the original electronic composition into something more lively and environmentally focused. The compositional intentions of the original Shelter remain at play here - this version still seeks to address the assumptions of multichannel listening, while affecting an environment of sound in preference to an experience of sound. However, this electroacoustic version adds a little bit of much needed chaos, allowing performers to interact and manipulate this sonic environment.

The transfixing acoustic ecologies of the southwest deserts demand a stillness that encourages a deeper environmental awareness and engagement. In many instances during our field trip we struggled to find locations without human interference. The distant hum of highway traffic and relentless airplanes under the flight path from LAX were expected, yet we also encountered unexpected sounds interfering with the acoustic ecologies of the land. These range from an obscure reverberating vending machine in Death Valley National Park to rattling power lines in the Jornada Biosphere Reserve that were so loud I could feel the vibrations through my feet.}

Nature Forms II explores the possibility of recursive re-interrogation of a field recording through visualization and resonification/resynthesis via machine and performative means. The source field recording is contrasted with artificially generated versions created with additive, subtractive and ring modulation resynthesis. Interaction between the live performers and the electronic components are explores through “spectral freezing” of components of the field recording to create spectrally derived chords from features of the recording bird sounds and a rusty gate which are then transcribed into notation for the instrumentalists and temporal manipulation of the recording to allow complex bird calls to be emulated in a human time-scale.

  abstract = {Program notes: Three short pieces for flute and micro-bats (world premiere).

This work uses data collected by Australian environmental scientist, Dr. Lindy Lumsden, in her research of native Australian micro bats. It uses data from bat-detecting devices: ultrasonic recording devices that recognize bat calls and transpose them down to the human hearing range. The data is analysed in the form of a spectrogram, and each species of bat is discerned by the shape and range of the calls. This piece uses the pitch and rhythm of bat calls as source material for the structure of each movement, and also uses the transposed calls throughout. The recordings are triggered at certain frequencies and dynamics of the flute via Max MSP, setting bats flying across the room (in 4 channels). The flute mimics different types of bat calls, triggering and reacting to the recordings and using its inherent flexibility to create a different voice in each register.

I. Victoria Circa 5.' There are 21 species of native bats in Victoria, all with unique calls above human hearing range. Like birds, these calls occur in different frequency levels so that different species of bat may co-exist without disturbing each other. A bat’s call bounces off the objects around it allowing it to ‘see’ at night, creating a beautiful cacophony that no one ever notices.

II. Melbourne Circa 5.' Did you think that bats only live in the bush? 17 of the 21 species of bats in Victoria can be found in metropolitan Melbourne, roosting in the hollows of our 100+-year-old trees. These fascinating creatures go largely unnoticed by all except the odd cat due to their size (most adult micro bats fit into a matchbox), speed, and auditory range (only a few species can be heard by humans, including the White-striped Freetail Bat). These bats are insectivorous and without them we’d be inundated with mosquitos and bugs.

III. Southern Bent-Wing Bat Circa 6.' Very little is known about this curious endangered species other than its secretive breeding place in a cave somewhere in South-West Victoria. These bats can be found all over Victoria, but unlike any other species of bat, they travel hundreds of miles to breed in one place. No one knows how the young bats know where to go, without flying in flocks like birds there’s no way for them to follow each other, so how do they know where to go? This is one of the questions that Dr. Lindy Lumsden hopes to answer in her research.}

It takes its name from the following line in Franz Kafka’s “A Crossbreed [A Sport]” (1931, trans. 1933): “On the moonlight nights its favourite promenade is along the eaves.” To compose the work, I developed custom software written in the programming languages of C and SuperCollider. I used these programs in different ways to process and sequence my source materials, which, in this case, included audio recordings of water, babies, and string instruments. Like other works in the series, I am interested in fabricating sonic regions of coincidence, where my coordinated mix of carefully selected sounds suggests relationships between the sounds and the illusions they foster.}

Rainwire is an experimental approach at technological appropriation of agricultural based objects for art and science, with particular emphasis on climate change issues and agriculture. This performance will present a live laptop mix of environmental sonification recordings from the newly built Rainwire prototype. Previous work on Rainwire has been conducted on shared instruments, this performance will be an opportunity to present the newly built dedicated Rainwire prototype in public for the first time in Australia. Long-wire instruments are made from spans of fencing wire across the open landscape. Rainwire developed from using contact mic recordings of rainfall ‘playing’ the long wire instruments for my music compositions. This enabled a proof of concept study to the extent that the audio recordings demonstrate a wide variety of temporal & spatial rain event complexity. This suggests that environmental sonification has great potential to measure rainfall accurately, & address recognized shortcomings of existing equipment & approaches in meteorology. Rain induced sounds with long wire instruments have a wide range of unique, audibly recognisable features. All of these sonic features exhibit dynamic volume & tonal characteristics, depending on the rain type & environmental conditions. Aside from the vast array of creative possibilities, the high spatial, temporal, volume & tonal resolution could provide significant advancement to knowledge of rainfall event profiles, intensity & microstructure. The challenge lies in identifying distinctive sound patterns & relating them to particular types of rainfall events. Rainwire is beyond simple sonification of data, it embeds technology & data collection within cultural contexts. With rainfall as catalyst to draw inspiration from, artists, scientists & cultural groups are key to informing science & incite new creative modalities.}

The researchers and contacts of course, were deep in Africa recording the sounds for their research. Threats of poaching are a reality and in one instance, although the researcher reached safety, the elephants weren't so lucky. Cornell University use a variety of technological platforms for their research both recording and processing of these recordings. The music created also uses a variety of technological and compositional methods to both utilise the sounds and to create something that is inspiring, innovative and become a whole listening experience. Through using different format types of sounds, for example: infrasonic sampled so that humans can hear them as well as regular files, the aim is to create relationships between the natural environment of the forest elephants, the other recorded acoustic occurrences while incorporating various instruments to create a conversation between the sonic environment, performer and listener.}

  abstract = {About the performer: Garth is particularly fascinated with sound as an experiential medium, both in musical performance and as an exhibitable object. This passion has led to several interactive responsive environments where the inhabitant generates the sonic landscape through their presence and behaviour. Garth has composed several music scores for dance generated through video tracking of the choreography, and more recently using Bio-Sensing on the dancers body. His immersive interactive environments have been exhibited in Australia, Europe, Japan, USA, Canada, UK, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Garth Paine is internationally regarded as an innovator in the field of interactivity in electronic music and media arts (some papers here). He gained his PhD in interactive immersive environments from the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Australia in 2003, and completed a Graduate Diploma in software engineering in the following year at Swinburne University. All a long way from his Bachelor of classical Flute performance from the conservatorium of Tasmania. Garth is Associate Professor in Digital Sound and Interactive Media at the School of Arts Media + Engineering at Arizona State University in the USA. His previous post was as Associate Professor of Sound Technologies at the University of Western Sydney, where he established the Virtual, Interactive, Performance Research environment (VIPRe) . He is often invited to run workshops on interactivity for musical performance and commissioned to develop interactive system for realtime musical composition for dance and theatre performances.}
