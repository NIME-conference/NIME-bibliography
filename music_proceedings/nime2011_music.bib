In LOLC, the musicians in the laptop orchestra use a textual performance interface, developed specifically for this piece, to create and share rhythmic motives based on a collection of recorded sounds. The environment encourages musicians to share their code with each other, developing an improvisational conversation over time as material is looped, borrowed, and transformed. LOLC was originally created by Akito van Troyer and Jason Freeman and is in active development at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology by Jason Freeman, Andrew Colella, Sang Won Lee and Shannon Yao. LOLC is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation as part of a larger research project on musical improvisation in performance and education (NSF CreativeIT#0855758).

About the performers:

Aaron Albin, Andrew Colella, Sertan Sentürk and Sang Won Lee are current degree candidates or alumni from the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology. All are focused on exploring new methods of musical interactivity through projects that involve current technology such as the Kinect, swarm robots, creative video games, and current MIR techniques.}

Licht & Hiebe (2010) is the first concert piece for the new Instrument: The ``Hexenkessel'' (witch's cauldron) is a modified 22" timpani that uses LLP technology to turn the drumhead into an intuitive multitouch-interface for the control of live-electronics \& dmx-stage-lights. The multitouch technique goes into symbiosis with a traditional instrument, keeping its acoustic qualities, but opening it to the vast possibilities of interactive multimedia. Besides the control of live-electronics the instrument features an interface to dmx-controlled stage-lights to create a situation of intense intermedial fireworks entirely controlled by the performer. The parts needed for this non-destructive timpani-hack cost less than \$500.

About the performers:

Jacob Sello (1976, Hamburg/Germany) studied Audio Engineering, Systematic Musicology and Multimedia Composition in Hamburg. He is highly interested in the exciting possibilities that arise from the conjunction of traditional acoustic instruments and state-of-the-art technology. Pieces for clarinet controlled RC- helicopters or DJ-driven pneumatically prepared disklavier pieces are the outcome.

Stefan Weinzierl (1985, Günzburg/Germany) is constantly searching for fascinating challenges beyond genre-boundaries; as a drummer in contemporary solo performances, classical ensembles and orchestras as well as in Jazz- and Rock/Pop bands. He graduated in educational sciences in Regensburg and completed the Percussion Master program at the HfMT Hamburg in 2010.}

Refraction of Your Gaze by Indeterminate Variables (ROYGBIV) is an effort to interface sound and the visible spectrum with digital and analog media. A collage of field recording, synth pad, and mechanical noise, ROYGBIV unfolds as wavelengths of light are read with discrete color sensors. Data is communicated through microcontrollers to custom audio software and a slide projector reproduces images of the natural world. ROYGBIV is concerned with fundamental properties of sensing, perception, and the technologies that mediate such experience. Metaphysical dimensions of color and sound are implied as the projected image and rainbow form a dialectic between reflection and refraction.

Originally an 8 channel tape piece, it was completely re-constructed as a live solo for the composer performing on a Karlax instrument – a gestural controller developed by Da Fact in France (see http://www.dafact.com/). Musically, "L'instant" is a musical interpretation of subatomic instantons, employing rotation and layering of parts who's rhythms and timbres are built out of the combining and crossing of series of numbers... The scenario is roughly “from the big bang to entropy”, and a “surround sound” 5.1 diffusion space is critical to the sense of immersion within the rotating sound objects and textures.

About the performer: Tom Mays: composer, computer musician and teacher, teaches at the National Superior Conservatory of Music in Paris, and is currently working on PhD at the University of Paris 8 with Horacio Vaggione. He is especially interested in gestural performance of real-time computer systems for both written and improvised music, as well as in interaction between music and video.}

An interactive audiovisual feedback loop forms the basis of All Hail the Dawn. The instrument contains two simple light-sensitive oscillators.  A crude spectral analysis in Max/MSP is used to filter the oscillators as well as looped buffers recorded from the instrument.  A matrix of the spectral analysis, interactively altered in Jitter using audio data, is projected back onto the instrument and performer as a series of shifting patterns.  This setup allows both the graphics and sound to drive each other, creating an evolving audiovisual relationship sensitive to slight changes in position, sound or processing.

The performance between electric violinist Victoria Johnson and Diemo Schwarz playing his interactive corpus-based concatenative synthesis software CataRT is an improvisation with two brains and four hands controlling one shared symbolic instrument, the sound space, built-up from nothing and nourished in unplanned ways by the sound of the instrument, explored and consumed with whatever the live instant filled it with. It creates a symbiotic relationship between the player of the instrument and that of the software. Live corpus-based concatenative synthesis permits here a new approach to improvisation, where sound from an instrument is recontextualised by interactive, gesture-controlled software. Not knowing what can happen is an integral part of the performance.

About the performers:

Victoria Johnson works with electric violin, live electronics, improvisation and musical technological issues in her artistic work. Trained as a classical violinist in Oslo, Vienna and London, she gave her debut recital in Oslo in 1995. She has established herself internationally as a soloist, chamber musician and improviser in contemporary, improvised and experimental, cross-disciplinary music and art.

Diemo Schwarz: Researcher and developer at Ircam, composer of electronic music, and musician on drums and laptop with gestural controllers. His compositions and live performances, in solo as Mean Time Between Failure, or improvising with other musicians, explore the possibilities of corpus-based concatenative synthesis to re-contextualise any sound source by rearranging sound units into a new musical framework using interactive navigation through a timbral space.}

The Loop explores the possibilities of co-located performance, decentralized composition, and the acoustics of network. This performance begins with a brief improvisation presenting acoustic sources to excite the network. This material is shared, transformed, and reintroduced into the composition. This process continues through successive generations until a predetermined time or a point at which the composition naturally concludes. The result is an integrated meta-instrument and an emergent composition, with no one artist being the sole performer or composer. Remote participants are represented locally by a mono speaker enabling the audiences to hear the transformation of audio through the networked instrument.

Dissonance is an audio/visual performance in which a progressive soundtrack is created along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment. While real instrument--generated music animates the projected worlds, the two performers are allowed to physically interact with virtual objects, changing their position, shape and color to control music and create new sounds. As the journey continues and the environment introduces new elements and new metaphors, performers are driven to explore the sonic laws that rule each scenario. Spectators wearing 3D glasses perceive the virtual environment as moving out of the screen and embracing the artists, in choreographies where real and virtual world literally overlap.

I also use pre-recorded sounds and my own compositions. In addition, since the beginning of 2010 we have been developing a new instrument, which goes beyond the technical possibilities of the Wii-controllers. I call this instrument the Shells. Besides motion sensors there are three more continuous controllers available: a pressure sensor, a joystick control and ultrasound for distance measurement.

An open playground for laptop improvisation and performance. BiLE's performance will focus on semi-structured improvisation, with players creating and manipulating sound using a variety of motion capture devices - iPhones, Wiimotes, and Xbox Kinect. The data captured by each device, along with analysed musical parameters, will be sent out over the shared network, to be used by each performer as they see fit. The aim is to allow players to latch onto other members of the group by mapping the shared data to their own software parameters, creating moments of convergence between the ensemble. BiLE takes an `instrumental' approach to performance, with each performer having their own speaker, sonic identity and spatial location.

About the performers:

BiLE (Birmingham Laptop Ensemble): A collaborative group of six composers, brought together through their shared interest in live performance and improvisation. BiLE has an open and inclusive attitude towards experimentation with sound, and draws on the members' wide-ranging musical backgrounds.}

As artists, we have learned that throughout the history of mankind music and technology have co-evolved, shaping --- and being shaped by --- human expression and creativity. The variety and intricacy of these recombination processes contribute profoundly to the current diversity of performative structures and aesthetics within the arts. Where art Thou? is a 15 minute theatrical performance where sounds are controlled by sensors on the dancer's body. Blending a mixture of electronic music and sound effects with dance and acting, this novel act refocuses sensors from simplistic action-to-sound to contextualized aesthetic and dramatic expression. The name reflects the itinerant quality of the stage character as he travels through a world of sounds.

About the performers:

Yago de Quay: Interactive media artist, musician and researcher based in Porto. His numerous installations and performances focus on user participation contributing to modify the art piece itself. They always have a strong sonic component and combine technologies to help create new modes of expression.

In this AV performance, images and sound interact: the basic elements of the images (brightness, color, saturation, hue, dislocation and relocation) are sensitive to the fundamental parameters of the sound being generated at that moment. Sound waves (also controlled by light waves during the performance) cross the physical world and alter the data stream that gives life to digital video in the same way that molecules are transformed by the sound contracting and expanding air particles in space.

About the performers:

Domenico Sciajno: Double bass player and composer of acoustic and electronic music. Thanks to his interest in improvisation and the influence of academic education, his research currently focuses on the creative possibilities provided by the interaction between acoustic instruments, indeterminacy factors and live processing by electronic devices or computers.}

Trondheim Voices is in this performance exploring a new tool in their work with voice sound and improvisation. The ensemble is working with a tracking system for sound positioning to enable a given singer's position on stage to directly influence the sound processing, both spatialisation and effects. Through their improvisations and compositions they are exploring: a) The effect of the sound “following”' the singers' movements on stage. b) The flexible use of processed voice sound within the big vocal ensemble, through the control each singer gets over the sound output by moving on stage. c) The visualization of choices and changes regarding sound, both for the performer and the audience, through the movements of each singer on stage.

About the performers:

Trondheim Voices Professional ensemble, working with the endless possibilities within the field of vocal improvisation, to find new expressions and new music. Consisting of individual soloists, Trondheim Voices wishes to develop what happens when the unique soloist quality of each singer is set to interact with each other, and to find the collective sound and feeling. All of the singers are educated at NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.

Sound: Asle Karstad. Tracking system: John Torger Skjelstad}

Flayed/Flock is a structured audio-visual improvisation for three musicians, utilizing live acoustic and electronic sound and interactive animations. The visual component of Flayed/Flock is an enhanced flocking simulation that interacts with real-time audio from the performance of improvising musicians. Abstract patterns develop out of the flocking behavior; the flocks are also able to coalesce into well-defined symbols and forms such as crescents and stars, all while moving in a natural-looking manner consistent with flocking behavior.

13 (Ivica Ico Bukvic): is a game of prime numbers and primal instincts pitting timbre against rhythm. Driven by conductor's oversight over an array of performer-specific and ensemble-wide parameters, a networked ensemble acts as one large meta-tracker where each individual performer contributes its own gesture-driven motives or tracks. The ensuing meta-tracker texture is superimposed against improvised acoustic percussion in a search of a meaningful discourse and ultimately musical synergy.

Serene (Ivica Ico Bukvic): ...the one moment in the day when the world melts away and we catch a glimpse of life that just is... a celebration of this moment through juxtaposition of Taiji (Tai Chi Chuan) choreography and music...

Citadel for soprano and L2Ork (Ivica Ico Bukvic) draws inspiration from a famous poem "Himna Slobodi" (Hymn to Freedom) by the 17th century Croatian poet Ivan Gundulic. As the first piece ever written for the newfound ensemble, it relies upon pervasive tonality, in many ways posing as an electronic counterpart to a traditional string ensemble. Using the infinite-bow metaphor to create lush tonal harmonies the piece forms a compelling aural foundation for a lyrical showcase of soloist's vocal talent.

=== About the performers:

L2Ork: Founded by Dr. Ivica Ico Bukvic in May 2009, is part of the latest interdisciplinary initiative by the Virginia Tech Music Department's Digital Interactive Sound \& Intermedia Studio (DISIS). As an emerging contemporary intermedia ensemble with a uniquely open design, L2Ork thrives upon the quintessential form of collaboration found in the western classical orchestra and its cross-pollination with increasingly accessible human-computer interaction technologies for the purpose of exploring expressive power of gesture, communal interaction, discipline-agnostic environment, and the multidimensionality of arts.

This piece is written in consideration of two distinct paradigms: telematic music performance and human-machine improvisation. Specifically this work is a structured improvisation for three humans and one intelligent agent, being constrained by sections that determine which pairing (duos, trios) of performers are active. Instrumentation also changes between sections in a way that blurs the line of agency and intent between acoustic human performers, laptop tablet-based human performer, and agent improviser, as the two remote (NY, Stanford) acoustic performers (v-accordion, soprano saxophone) engage with the on-stage laptop performer (GREIS system) and ambient presence of the agent performer (spatialization, loops, textures).
