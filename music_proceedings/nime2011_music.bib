  abstract = {In LOLC, the musicians in the laptop orchestra use a textual performance interface, developed specifically for this piece, to create and share rhythmic motives based on a collection of recorded sounds. The environment encourages musicians to share their code with each other, developing an improvisational conversation over time as material is looped, borrowed, and transformed. LOLC was originally created by Akito van Troyer and Jason Freeman and is in active development at the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology by Jason Freeman, Andrew Colella, Sang Won Lee and Shannon Yao. LOLC is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation as part of a larger research project on musical improvisation in performance and education (NSF CreativeIT#0855758). About the performers: Aaron Albin, Andrew Colella, Sertan Sentürk and Sang Won Lee are current degree candidates or alumni from the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology. All are focused on exploring new methods of musical interactivity through projects that involve current technology such as the Kinect, swarm robots, creative video games, and current MIR techniques.}

The multitouch technique goes into symbiosis with a traditional instrument, keeping its acoustic qualities, but opening it to the vast possibilities of interactive multimedia. Besides the control of live-electronics the instrument features an interface to dmx-controlled stage-lights to create a situation of intense intermedial fireworks entirely controlled by the performer. The parts needed for this non-destructive timpani-hack cost less than \$500. About the performers: Jacob Sello (1976, Hamburg/Germany) studied Audio Engineering, Systematic Musicology and Multimedia Composition in Hamburg. He is highly interested in the exciting possibilities that arise from the conjunction of traditional acoustic instruments and state-of-the-art technology. Pieces for clarinet controlled RC- helicopters or DJ-driven pneumatically prepared disklavier pieces are the outcome. Stefan Weinzierl (1985, Günzburg/Germany) is constantly searching for fascinating challenges beyond genre-boundaries; as a drummer in contemporary solo performances, classical ensembles and orchestras as well as in Jazz- and Rock/Pop bands. He graduated in educational sciences in Regensburg and completed the Percussion Master program at the HfMT Hamburg in 2010.}

The t-sticks form a family of tubular digital musical instruments, ranging in length from 0.6 metres (soprano) to 1.2 metres (tenor). They have been designed and constructed to allow a large variety of unique interaction techniques. As a result, a significant emphasis is placed on the gestural vocabulary required to manipulate and manoeuvre the instrument. The musical experience for both the performer and audience is characterised by a unique engagement between performer body and instrument. About the performers: D.

Originally an 8 channel tape piece, it was completely re-constructed as a live solo for the composer performing on a Karlax instrument – a gestural controller developed by Da Fact in France (see http://www.dafact.com/). Musically, "L'instant" is a musical interpretation of subatomic instantons, employing rotation and layering of parts who's rhythms and timbres are built out of the combining and crossing of series of numbers... The scenario is roughly “from the big bang to entropy”, and a “surround sound” 5.1 diffusion space is critical to the sense of immersion within the rotating sound objects and textures. About the performer: Tom Mays: composer, computer musician and teacher, teaches at the National Superior Conservatory of Music in Paris, and is currently working on PhD at the University of Paris 8 with Horacio Vaggione. He is especially interested in gestural performance of real-time computer systems for both written and improvised music, as well as in interaction between music and video.}

It creates a symbiotic relationship between the player of the instrument and that of the software. Live corpus-based concatenative synthesis permits here a new approach to improvisation, where sound from an instrument is recontextualised by interactive, gesture-controlled software.

About the performers: Victoria Johnson works with electric violin, live electronics, improvisation and musical technological issues in her artistic work. Trained as a classical violinist in Oslo, Vienna and London, she gave her debut recital in Oslo in 1995. She has established herself internationally as a soloist, chamber musician and improviser in contemporary, improvised and experimental, cross-disciplinary music and art. Diemo Schwarz: Researcher and developer at Ircam, composer of electronic music, and musician on drums and laptop with gestural controllers. His compositions and live performances, in solo as Mean Time Between Failure, or improvising with other musicians, explore the possibilities of corpus-based concatenative synthesis to re-contextualise any sound source by rearranging sound units into a new musical framework using interactive navigation through a timbral space.}

  abstract = {An open playground for laptop improvisation and performance. BiLE's performance will focus on semi-structured improvisation, with players creating and manipulating sound using a variety of motion capture devices - iPhones, Wiimotes, and Xbox Kinect. The data captured by each device, along with analysed musical parameters, will be sent out over the shared network, to be used by each performer as they see fit. The aim is to allow players to latch onto other members of the group by mapping the shared data to their own software parameters, creating moments of convergence between the ensemble. BiLE takes an `instrumental' approach to performance, with each performer having their own speaker, sonic identity and spatial location. About the performers: BiLE (Birmingham Laptop Ensemble): A collaborative group of six composers, brought together through their shared interest in live performance and improvisation. BiLE has an open and inclusive attitude towards experimentation with sound, and draws on the members' wide-ranging musical backgrounds.}

  abstract = {As artists, we have learned that throughout the history of mankind music and technology have co-evolved, shaping --- and being shaped by --- human expression and creativity. The variety and intricacy of these recombination processes contribute profoundly to the current diversity of performative structures and aesthetics within the arts. Where art Thou? is a 15 minute theatrical performance where sounds are controlled by sensors on the dancer's body. Blending a mixture of electronic music and sound effects with dance and acting, this novel act refocuses sensors from simplistic action-to-sound to contextualized aesthetic and dramatic expression. The name reflects the itinerant quality of the stage character as he travels through a world of sounds. About the performers: Yago de Quay: Interactive media artist, musician and researcher based in Porto. His numerous installations and performances focus on user participation contributing to modify the art piece itself. They always have a strong sonic component and combine technologies to help create new modes of expression. Yago is currently finishing his M.Sc. in Sound Design and Interactive Music at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. Ståle Skogstad: PhD student in the fourMs group at the University of Oslo. His research is focused on using real-time full-body motion capture technology for musical interaction. This includes real-time feature extraction from full body motion capture data and technical studies of motion capture technologies. He is currently working with the Xsens MVN inertial sensor suit.}

Driven by conductor's oversight over an array of performer-specific and ensemble-wide parameters, a networked ensemble acts as one large meta-tracker where each individual performer contributes its own gesture-driven motives or tracks. The ensuing meta-tracker texture is superimposed against improvised acoustic percussion in a search of a meaningful discourse and ultimately musical synergy.

Citadel for soprano and L2Ork (Ivica Ico Bukvic) draws inspiration from a famous poem "Himna Slobodi" (Hymn to Freedom) by the 17th century Croatian poet Ivan Gundulic. As the first piece ever written for the newfound ensemble, it relies upon pervasive tonality, in many ways posing as an electronic counterpart to a traditional string ensemble. Using the infinite-bow metaphor to create lush tonal harmonies the piece forms a compelling aural foundation for a lyrical showcase of soloist's vocal talent. === About the performers: L2Ork: Founded by Dr. Ivica Ico Bukvic in May 2009, is part of the latest interdisciplinary initiative by the Virginia Tech Music Department's Digital Interactive Sound \& Intermedia Studio (DISIS).

Instrumentation also changes between sections in a way that blurs the line of agency and intent between acoustic human performers, laptop tablet-based human performer, and agent improviser, as the two remote (NY, Stanford) acoustic performers (v-accordion, soprano saxophone) engage with the on-stage laptop performer (GREIS system) and ambient presence of the agent performer (spatialization, loops, textures).
