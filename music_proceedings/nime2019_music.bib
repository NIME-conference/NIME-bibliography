  abstract = {Bad Mother / Good Mother is an audiovisual performance involving a projection, a modified electronic breast pump as a sound generator, and a sound- reactive LED pumping costume. The project has four songs that critically explore technologies directed specifically at women like breast pumps and fertility extending treatments such as egg-freezing (social freezing). Depending on the song, the breast pump is either a solo instrument or part of an arrangement. The idea is to use workplace lactation as a departure point to uncover a web of societal politics and pre-conceived perceptions (pun intended) of ideal and non-ideal motherhood.}

  abstract = {Borrowed voices is a performance featuring performative voice synthesis, with two types of instruments: C-Voks and T-Voks. The voices are played a cappella in a double choir of natural and synthetic voices. Performative singing synthesis is a new paradigm in the already long history of artificial voices. The singing voice is played like an instrument, allowing singing with the borrowed voice of another. The relationship of embodiment between the singer's gestures and the vocal sound produced is broken. A voice is singing, with realism, expressivity and musicality, but it is not the musician's own voice, and a vocal apparatus does not control it. The project focuses on control gestures: the music explores vocal sounds produced by the vocal apparatus (the basic sound material), and “played” by the natural voice, by free-hand Theremin-controlled gestures, and by writing gestures on a graphic tablet. The same (types of) sounds but different gestures give different musical “instruments” and expressive possibilities. Another interesting aspect is the distance between synthetic voices and the player, the voice being at the same time embodied (by the player gestures playing the instrument with her/his body) and externalized (because the instrument is not her/his own voice): two different voices sung/played by the same person.}

  abstract = {colligation (to bring or tie together) is a physical performance work for one performer that explores the idea of sculpting sound through gesture. Treating sound as if it were a tangible object capable of being fashioned into new sonic forms, "pieces" of sound are captured, shaped and sculpted by the performer's hand and arm gestures, appearing pliable as they are thrown around and transformed into new sonic material. colligation uses two Thalmic Labs Myo armbands, one placed on the left arm and the other on the right arm. The Myo Mapper [1] software is used to transmit scaled data via OSC from the armbands to Pure Data. Positional (yaw, pitch and roll) and electromyographic data (EMG) from the devices are mapped to parameters controlling a hybrid synth created in Pure Data. The synth utilises a combination of Phase Aligned Formant synthesis [2] and Frequency Modulation synthesis [3] to allow a range of complex audio spectra to be explored. Pitch, yaw and roll data from the left Myo are respectively mapped to the PAF synth's carrier frequency (ranging from 8.175-12543.9Hz), bandwidth and relative centre frequency. Pitch, yaw and roll data from the right Myo are respectively mapped to FM modulation frequency (relative to and ranging from 0.01-10 times the PAF carrier frequency), modulation depth (relative to and ranging from 0.01-10 times the PAF carrier frequency), and modulation wave shape (crossfading between sine, triangle, square, rising sawtooth and impulse). Data from the left and right Myo's EMG sensors are mapped respectively to amplitude control of the left and right audio channels, giving the performer control over the level and panning of the audio within the stereo field. By employing both positional and bio data, an embodied relationship between action and response is created; the gesture and the resulting sonic transformation become inextricably entwined.}

After an installation prompt, they are guided through a series of demos, in which a software assistant instructs the performer to accomplish several tasks. Through their playing, the performer controls the cursor's navigation and clicking behavior. In lieu of a traditional score, the performer relies on text instructions and visual indicators from a software assistant. The software tracks the progress of the user throughout the piece and moves onto the next section only once a task has been completed. Each of the main tasks takes place on the web, where the user navigates across YouTube, Wikipedia, and Google Maps.}

This work aims to integrate music concrete techniques and an algorithmic compositional approach in the context of composition for gestural controllers. While music concrete compositional practice brings out the concept of “composite object”—a sound object made up of several distinct and successive elements [1]—in the piece, our algorithmic compositional approach delivers an interpolation technique which entails gradual transformations of the composite objects over time. Our challenge is to perform a chain of short fragmental elements in tandem in the way to form a single musical unit, while the algorithms for transformation are autonomously changing synthetic and control parameter settings. This approach derives closely interconnected triangular interactions between two performers and a computer.}

Traditional musical instruments always have fixed physical forms that require performers to adjust to them. How about making a musical instrument that is more fluid and more expressive via deforming according to performers' movements? This was the question I attempted to explore when I started making this project. For this project, I combine the movement of dancing with music to present a fluid and dynamic shape of musical instrument. The fabric of this instrument can be separated as an extension to wash. It's portable, wireless, chargeable, stable and beautiful. This musical instrument generates sound by detecting different movements of the performer. It has four different modes selected by toggling the switches on the instrument interface. Each mode has different movement detection methods, generating various sound and music. Moreover, it can be played as a transmitting Tambourine. As for the music in my performance, it's all played by myself lively, consisting of different sound triggered and changed by performers' gestures and melody composed myself. Like the name of this instrument River, the four toggles and their detection methods and their corresponding generated sounds are intentionally designed. From simple node, beat, loop, drum, to various node, melody, music, the detection methods and their triggered sounds are becoming more and more complex and various, developing like a journey of a river.}

  abstract = {"Tanto Mar" seeks to recreate the properties present in history between Portugal and Brazil, embracing the idea of an aqueous sound that dances and moves as much by cadence as by voluminous waves. The Atlantic Ocean, which separates and unites the two countries, serves as an inspiration for this quadraphonic performance, involving musical instruments and live electronics, where the sounds move through the four speakers. Each speaker symbolizes the paths that the sea travels uninterruptedly, in a unique dance of latitudes and longitudes. The intersection of sounds occurs through processes of reverberations, spatializations, echoes, modulations and grains that slowly form the sound material, composing, decomposing and manipulating the sound waves. Sound characters such as wind, oars, storms, calm, among others, are metaphorically evidenced through the sound material, creating a kind of rhythmic movement of a caravel at sea. The sounds of "Tanto Mar" move between entropy and chaos, between stillness and tsunami, between starboard and port, culminating in a textural dance where the objective is to take the listener away from electronic processing, and propose a dive in an intensified, attentive, deep and involving listening. New musical possibilities can happen through the experimentation of new routes, unusual routes and horizons not yet covered. The sea and its imprecise distances represent permanent challenges. "Tanto Mar" seeks to revive the feeling of the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, when he wrote: "to dream even if it is impossible".}

The flute player develops two pieces of experimental music for flute and electronic. All these heterogeneous elements are interrelated with each other in a network mediated by the computer. The result is a continuously unfolded interactive performance, which intends to manipulate settings of space-time perception.

We sought for creating a work for one, hybrid corporeality, in which a dancer and a musician would co-creatively and co- dependently interact with their bodies and a machine. The challenge, then, was how could two performers with distinct embodied skills unite in a continuous entanglement of intentions, senses and experiences to control the same sonic and musical parameters? This was conceptually different than they had done before in the context of interactive dance performances.}

The We Bass performance is an exploration of the symbiosis of two performers playing the same instrument: Their actions have direct consequence on the resulting sound, challenging the other player with instability and interference. From the experiments of the English scientist Thomas Young (1773-1829) on the phenomena of diffraction and interference of light waves, we observe that interferences generated by overlapping light waves can have a character of annihilation, when they are out of phase (destructive interference), or a reinforcing character when in phase (constructive interference). From this reflection we try to deepen the discussion about the interferences of the performers inputs involved in a free improvisation session. We seek a model of connection between the performers that promotes processes of creation in the free improvisation, exploring the dialectics between reinforcement actions (processes of interaction that reinforces a certain sound moment) and movement actions (that destabilizes and transforms the flow). We Bass is a duo performance exploring the interactions between the musicians playing one hybrid machine: an electric upright bass guitar with live electronics processing. The instrument consists of an electric upright bass with movement sensors and a live processing machine with a controller that interacts with the sensors, changing some processing parameters and some controller mapping settings, creating an instable ground for the musicians.}
