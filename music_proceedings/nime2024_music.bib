  abstract = {A live performance of two co-created telematic EDM works that were devised using L2Ork Tweeter platform. Both works were premiered in December 2023. In addition, performance can also include projection mapping element. The proposed performances may be particularly conducive to a club scene and other less conventional performance spaces. The two works are Territorio Prismático (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oVbAWTlp-E), and the 8-bit Petal (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDMiE2OkGNA). Every facet of both works is co-created by the ensemble members, including instrument design, part composition, and performance. The final iteration of both works is curated by the L2Ork Director Ivica Ico Bukvic. The conference performance will be live, and will feature L2Ork community ensemble members consisting of volunteer co-creators and performers from all over the world, with physical distances exceeding 11,000 miles. Community members partaking in this performance will be announceed at the performance. A visual projection counterpart to the performance led by the visual artist Thomas Tucker will take place synchronously on Virgina Tech campus.},

  abstract = {Curiosity does not always kill a cat, sometimes it makes a god. Welcome to the world of ‘When the Rain God Sings, Storm Lions Are Born’ (‘Rain Gods’) by multi-award winning composer Yunyu. This is a supernatural world of cats, thunder and new gods. The old god has gone fishing, you see, so she leaves her drums for the next unsuspecting human to play, for this is how new gods are made. This is the world where drums play tunes and cats must first be appeased and fed so they can grow up and make thunder for the new gods. It is all very hard work. Commissioned by Taikoz, Percussion Australia and brought to life by the masterful Ryuji Hamada, Yunyu re-purposes a linear DAW, Logic X with a goal of turning a single performer into a performer/conductor. This is a seamless exploration of musical composition and instrument making, where traditional playing techniques of Taiko drumming are considered and mapped onto their electronic counterparts [Roland’s Taiko-1], pushing the limits of what taiko playing can be. This is a cautionary tale for the accidental gods amongst us. In a further development by Vfx Artist/Director Emma Smith, the performance intertwines sound and light with reactive weather patterns and a responsive ecosystem primarily comprised of cats, all changing in response to the playful musical landscape. Keep an eye out for the installation that accompanies this this performance – ‘Be your own Rain God’ where audiences can make their own thunderstorm. This is a tale of negotiation between environmental forces and human will, where humankind are not always in control although we often think we are.},

A new sound language based on phonetic symbols, designed using SuperCollider, is read aloud on the custom-built body-worn Arduino instruments. The pain of a hurting woman is difficult to convey to others. Instead of language, the content of pain has been vocalized through whimpers, cries, screams, or silence. Following in the footsteps of generations of women who have attempted to verbalize their pain, the language dismantles the existing [consonant+vowel] language system. Instead, it incorporates the structure of [sound+vowel] to interpret the writings of women who came before us. At the same time, the language is an attempt to vocally communicate the chronic pain of the composer/performer herself, who suffers from fibromyalgia. The process of physically translating the new language, Monster Voice, through the custom-built body-worn instruments revive and give voice to the pain of the composer/performer and the women of previous generations.},

The MPO concept is designed to embrace people regardless their musical backgrounds as performers, but still with an aim to generate expressive and meaningful artistic expressions for concert hall performances. In a performance the MPO consist of 20-40 people, divided in 6 individual parts. They perform using their phones, and the dedicated MPO Web-API, as instrument interfaces. Animated notation is showing performance instructions for the 6 individual parts and conducting the performance. Voyage One was composed in 2017, during the early stages of development of the MPO platform. The work is a single movement composition, where 6 individual voices are introduced one after another to slowly build up an orchestral harmonic texture towards a concluding climax. The composition is characterized by extremely tight constraints, where only four pitches are used in each voice, based on the previous conditions of the mobile phone orchestra's instrument interface. The challenge lay in creating musical coherence within this limitation of four pitches per voice by organizing the interaction among the six voices. Voyage One was composed as an initial journey into the unknown where the MPO becomes a metaphor for the collective and the importance of interaction in creating meaning.},

The sensor data from the physical gestures are converted to control voltage (CV) to manipulate parameters in the modular setup. Creating this system was informed by my use of the MiM sensor bell for more than seven years. Given the extensive time I have spent working with the sensor component of the system, my awareness of how certain bodily movement creates particular gestural input is rather detailed. This understanding, combined with the knowledge gained through analyzing performance videos through an embodied perspective, helps me to make informed decisions in the process of designing the mapping that controls the intermedial translation.},

Each element of this performance controls and is controlled by the tightly regimented constraints around making musical meaning together. ‘Three is a crowd?’ is a continuation of Co-Creative Spaces presented at NIME 2023 and builds on both the experiences and software (CCCP) from that project. The agents in Co-Creative Spaces generate sound by picking from a corpus of recorded material from the human musicians. How these collections were curated and put together was an important artistic decision for the co-creation process. This gave the musicians a closeness to the material that was seen as positive, but at the same time there was a recurring wish that the agents could have their own voice to a greater extent. “Three is a crowd?” is the first step in exploring other ways of giving the non-human agents more explicit agency in a performance by introducing a simple control algorithm that will guide the musical performance through text-based prompts.},

It is an exploration of the capabilities of a prototype of musical instrument — the HexApp — a digital processing engine developed to transform the sound of multichannel acoustic input in real-time. This instrumental & live-electronics performance is a solo set in which the performer interacts in a balanced relationship with the computer in the process of decision making providing memorable spatial sonic experience for the listener. It explores unconventional instrumental approaches as well as compositional strategies applied in real-time improvisatory domain. Furthermore, the performance delves into the magnetic properties of the hexaphonic pickup used as a sound source — multichannel input of the real-time processing system. The sound transformations occupy a broad spectrum of musical expressivity ranging from immersive slowly unfolding and evolving textures to emerging sharply articulated grainy sonic entities. HexApp is an instrument which could be described as a hybrid, acoustic - digital, naturally - artificial, traditionally - innovative hybrid of six independently depending on each other, unpredictably predictable constituents of a dynamically - motionless soundscape. The HexApp uses the Max/MSP/Jitter environment for processing the multichannel input. The project implements custom built modules based on processes such as ring modulation, delay, transposition, flanging, granulation, feedback and any combination between them. The control over processes is both manual through a MIDI controller and automated through a limited randomness provided through the digital environment itself. },

  abstract = {My grandmother, Nana, passed away in New York in the winter of 2020. With the coronavirus still raging, none of my extended family was able to fly east to pack up her apartment. The task, instead, fell to my girlfriend, Amanda, who was living in the city at the time. Near the end of the process, I received a voice memo from Amanda. Sitting at my grandmother’s piano, she recorded one of the last scores that hadn’t been boxed away: Edward MacDowell’s “To a Wild Rose.” For such a gentle and unassuming piece, the music carried startling gravitas. It seemed to me that the music served as the parting statement of an apartment where my grandparents had spent so much of their lives, the last expression of a place that was central to my notion of family. Amanda’s recording allowed me to play and replay its “voice” as often as I needed. "Lucky" explores the ways in which ‘To a Wild Rose’ has helped me process Nana’s death–how it has served as an expression of my grief and a gateway to my memories, as well as a shaper of both. ‘Lucky’ is dedicated to Nana.},

While the bass player plays natural harmonics with various articulations adapting to and intervening in the natural flow of information among the entities, the CT player regulates the output of the computer and plays the bass by moving one of the transducers. This interface offers new possibilities of performance that incorporate the tactility of the physical entities, digital transformation of mechanically produced sounds, and a distributed network of human and nonhuman agents.},

In the opera, Xiang Yu is surrounded by Liu Bang's forces and on the verge of total defeat. Realizing the dire situation that has befallen them, Xiang Yu’s wife, Consort Yu, begs to die alongside her husband, but he strongly refuses her wish. Afterwards, as he is distracted, Yu commits suicide with Xiang Yu's own sword. I tried to create connections between traditional Peking opera and contemporary electronic music. First, I used timbres and rhythms similar to those used by ‘The Hegemon-King Bids His Lady Farewell’. Also, the musical use of unstable pulses, such as tempo rubato and voice glissando in Peking opera, can relate to the color of contemporary music. Second, I used traditional Peking opera singing style throughout the vocal part. I also used some similar lines from the Peking opera but changed some notes to add different harmonic colors. In the electronics, I sometimes imitated the rhythms the Peking opera, and at other times made different granulated layers of various singing styles in Peking opera. Moreover, I used Leap Motion to better control the gestures of Peking opera in a live performance setting.},

  abstract = {Fulgura Frango is a composition for extended harpsichord and electronics. It is conceptually inspired by Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre's opera Céphale et Procris, and many of its techniques refer to Cephale’s bow and arrow that mistakenly pierced Procris’s unwavering heart. Procris is represented by a steady passacaglia reminiscent of de la Guerre’s baroque harmonies, and it is interrupted by multiple interventions: bowing of an amplified horsehair tied to a harpsichord string, goose quill glissandos on the upper tuning pins, and e-bow placements on a small psaltery. In this tragic love story, the cycle of bowing and being stricken represents a perpetual shooting and dying and loving and shooting and dying and loving. In addition, the performer controls frequency shifting parameters through a max patch that takes in his breath data as measured through a hexoskin.  Thoracic inhale pitch-shifts up, whereas abdominal inhale pitch-shifts down, so a taking in a breath increases resulting frequency output.  Though harpsichord is not a wind instrument, the musician’s breath is an interesting and often unnoticed part of the performance.  The performer can also intentionally manipulate the live electronics with their breath, adding another dimension to the composition.},

The design was built using Unreal Engine, controlled with commercially available midi controllers, and requires two users to operate. The performance was conceived to further explore the Evangistrums possibilities for collaboration and resonance. It was developed as a composition in three parts, with semi-improvised melodic and rhythmic content. The premiere performance in a local church, and the rehearsals leading up to them, including the composition process, were designed as a micro-study, exploring how to learn to play and create on a newly developed instrument, and for the organist how to learn to play with a newly developed instrument. The Evangistrum was further developed during and between these sessions, relating both to the experience of playing and learning the instrument, as well as to composing the music.},

Using a blank disc and a handheld transducer (a ‘cutterhead’), sound is ‘tattooed’ on to the record surface, while multiple tonearms track the evolving grooves. Unlike in traditional ‘record cutting’, which generally lacks agency, the performer can modify anywhere on the disc as well as adjust angle and pressure during inscription. As a result, it is possible to create commercial record-like grooves or undertake more experimental practice such as cross-groove inscription, or overcutting, eliciting sonic characteristic and/or tonearm behaviour change. The cutterhead is fed by audio from looped sections of Maholy-Nagy’s 1933 optical sound film Tönendes ABC and the signals from the pickups are subjected to further processing and effects during performance. As in turntablism and sound art practices, the limitations of phonographic disc as recording medium are celebrated: the repetition of locked grooves are employed to build performance and clicks, pops and other artefacts of process are incorporated into the overall aesthetic. By using a handheld inscription approach, human ‘inaccuracy’ in a medium dependant on microvariation manifests as medium liveness and thereby enables the record and interface to act as performance partner.},

The system's response consists of a manipulation of the real double-bass, achieved live through a timbre-transfer neural network, granular synthesis, and reverberation. The timbre-transfer network was trained on generic double-bass recordings, resulting in a peculiar ‘hybrid’ double-bass sound. We Machine listening is integrated in the form of a real-time classifier of extended techniques played on the double-bass, whose output controls the sound manipulation process to affect various techniques differently. The personal extended techniques chosen for Esteso are: ‘Brushed’ Jeté, Sfregato con legno, and Percussive. Here, we propose a 10/15 minutes improvised duet performance where the double bass player interacts with Esteso, creating an action-reaction interplay between acoustic and virtual.},

  abstract = {ALÉAS is a cycle of 12 transdisciplinary creations, which combines music (acoustic and electroacoustic) and visual creations (drawings, collages, objects, photographs and videos) with original poetry. Stemming from cosmological reflections, these works question the conception that we have of the universe that surrounds us, through poetic journeys exploring nature and matter (including the five fundamental elements: water, air, earth, fire, cosmos). This creative work is inspired by the concept of diagonal sciences of Roger Caillois, a form of interdisciplinarity of knowledge, in which the invisible, the underground relations must be exhumed in order to allow the emergence of a new and more complex image of the universe. Thus, in these compositions, the intertwining of sounds, images and poetry triggers multiple perceptions in synesthesia, blurring the boundaries between reality, illusion and imagination. This first composition of the cycle, ‘Streamed knowledge of solids’ is inspired by the materials that form the earth. Although they seem at first sight to be inert substances, rocks carry within them their whole history. A multitude of elements from the past are inscribed in their geological constitution, shaped over millennia by melting, sedimentation and water runoff. The structure and shape of each stone tells us where it came from and how it came to end up in that particular and unique shape. Matter can thus reveal profound knowledge. The work is performed on the Hyper-Bass-Flute, an instrument on which multiple sensors captures the subtle tactility and movements of the performer. They interact with live electronic processing of the flute’s acoustic sound, as well as with the photo and video images that are mixed in real time and vary constantly. All electroacoustic sounds of the piece are generated in real time from the sounds of the live performed bass flute. Only the voice of the poet was recorded to be added to this performance.},

In this performance, e-textile pieces are patched into a no-input mixer, while player uses interactive machine learning tools to embroider sonic layers onto a repeated gesture. Analog audio signals from a no-input mixing board are routed through a piezoresistive mat which has been knitted from wool and steel yarns. The performer first develops a patch on the no-input mixing board to sound a two-handed pressing gesture on the mat. Then, the they alternate between performing the gesture and refining mappings between a machine listing algorithm and additional layers of sound using the anguilla interactive machine learning package.},

  abstract = {‘PlayTrainPlay’ is a structured solo human-computer improvisation in two parts. It combines instrumental improvisation with granular synthesis, machine listening and neural networks. Through its structure, PlayTrainPlay describes the process of collecting data, training a neural network and interacting with the resulting model through musical performance; its structure can also be said to represent the transition from a physical effects interface to a data-based one. These concepts are additionally communicated through the projection of live visuals consisting of code outputs, performance footage and abstract audio-reactive images. Section 1 employs a real-time granular effect whose parameters are manipulated via a foot controller. Over the course of this section, analysis of the saxophone's timbre and corresponding effect parameters are logged before the performer triggers training of the neural network. In Section 2, the neural network controls the effect, which is deployed in a loop that the performer interacts with. This work motivates further use of data model-based interfaces for instrumental effects by instrumentalists themselves. It proposes the use of data collection and modelling during performance as a means to create unique situation-based interactions. Lastly, it promotes the use of neural networks as a way of simplifying musicians' workflows.},

  abstract = {‘What it means to be post-human’, explores the intersection of technology and human performance. Drawing inspiration from ‘A Dialogue, In Absentia’, this work advances the concept of integrating human performers with digital sound processing in a futuristic, collective context. The composition utilizes purpose built, original Bluetooth speakers and headset devices to direct processed sounds into performers' mouths, enabling them to modulate audio output through physical movements. This innovative approach transforms performers into live acoustical filters, adding human texture to digital sounds, and challenges traditional distinctions between musicians and instruments. The compositional framework employs a hocket technique to create a cohesive auditory experience from individual inputs, embodying the NIME 2024 theme ‘Tactility in a hybrid world‘. This piece exemplifies the fusion of tactile human interaction and digital technology in music, highlighting sustainability and adaptability in post-pandemic performance contexts. ‘What it means to be post-human‘ contributes to the discourse on new musical interfaces by redefining the role of the human body in musical expression and demonstrating the enhanced possibilities when merging human and technological elements. The composition invites reevaluation of musical performance boundaries and exemplifies the potential of technology in expanding the capabilities of human artistic expression. This work not only adds to the field of musical technology but also provokes thought about the future of human and digital collaboration in art.},

  abstract = {Over the past two years, an abundance of e-waste has grown on the streets of Belfast City. Keeping company with the plastic packaging and drinks containers one has grown to expect are so-called disposable vapes or e-cigarettes. This e-waste has a new identity; it exists outside landfill sites and WEEE collection points. This is e-waste as litter! For the digital instrument makers and composer-designers who author this group, this situation illustrates the disconnect many of us hold between what we consume and its means of production. The composite nature of most products renders them and their associated supply chains highly complex. Furthermore, manufacturers must be more forthcoming in highlighting ethical issues in their supply chains. This performance is a small act of resistance. The instruments used are powered by disposable vape batteries, highlighting the value of this rechargeable resource, which we're told to throw away. Doing so opens a space for conversations around the human rights issues at the bottom of the lithium battery supply chain. In the spirit of inclusive musicking, the group invites attendees from the companion NIME 2024 Vapour Waves workshop to perform alongside their bespoke creations as part of a locally-populated, crowdsourced group of performers. The piece is composed with ample space for improvisation. Four short movements showcase the instrument's potential, focusing on harmonic drones, rhythmic interplay, timbral variation and the ability to create tension between control and chaos. The limitations of the technology are productive constraints to be explored. Incorporating the NIME 2024 theme, these Vapour Wave instruments are inherently tactile; they invite touch and physical manipulation. Our ‘hybrid world’ manifests in the instrument's use of bought and found components.},

  abstract = {This performance presents, through artistic means, the current state of development of the feedback-augmented bass clarinet—a NIME instrument previously created by the two authors. The performance aims to showcase improvements made to the instrument, both in terms of hardware and software. Regarding hardware and instrument design, after experimenting with different neck extensions realized through CAD and 3D printing—enabling the insertion of our first microphone into the instrument body and a more refined tuning of the instrument—we decided to focus on the use of an intra-mic to capture the bass clarinet sound. This not only ultimately addressed previous issues with tuning, but also enhanced the playability of the feedback-augmented bass clarinet, aligning it more closely with traditional performance practices. Consequently, this augmented instrument is potentially approachable by a larger number of performers. Improvements in the software, such as in-depth control of the audio routing and a feedback calibration routine, have addressed issues related to the freedom and playability of the system that the authors experienced while working on the previous model. The performance features a new version of the piece ‘WYPYM - Were you a part of your mother?’, for bass clarinet and feedback system. The work explores the relationship between the performer on the augmented bass clarinet and the feedback system, and is based on active listening, constant adaptation, and precarious balance.},

It adapts the Sabetan technique of Indonesia's Wayang Kulit shadow puppetry, aiming to demonstrate embodied audio-visual interaction. Sabetan involves expressive gestures by the puppeteer, conforming to the scene's characterization. The embodied interaction is performative, creating audio and visual elements simultaneously. It draws on Michael Chion's ‘added-value’ concept. A choreographed hand movement, incorporating Sabetan, facilitates real-time interaction with a depth camera and machine learning. This concept is implemented in Ciung Wanara, an interactive music system integrating Wayang Kulit and supervised machine learning. The system also employs the Polymorphism Sound synthesis method. ""Ciung Wanara"" is an interactive audiovisual composition inspired by Indonesian shadow puppet battles. It features rooster avatars responding to the performer's gestures, recreating the tale of Ciung Wanara, a wise king defeating an evil sorcerer. The Sabetan technique and FluComa machine learning enable simultaneous control of sound synthesis, spatialization, and visuals. Two avatars with a narrative driven by hand gestures create a unique immersive experience, uncommon in traditional audiovisual composition, engaging both performer and audience.},

In performance the digital score produces a plethora of graphic symbols—from simple ink blot-esque dots and abstract globular shapes to complex webs of broken grid patterns interacting with sharp and angular geometric shapes. The electroacoustic aspects of this work utilize mixer feedback. Mixer feedback is created when the inputs of the mixer are routed back into its outputs to create a (feedback) loop. Manipulating the mixer’s, faders, dials, and buttons creates unpredictable electronic sounds ranging from simple and harmonious to chaotic and noisy. The setup for generative open graphic score #1 consists of an instrumentalist patched into a mixer with feedback loops being played by another performer. In this novel electroacoustic setup, the sounds, and timbres of the two instruments can clash and contrast or synthesize and melt together. In performance, the instrument patched into the mixer transmutes into a noise-laden super-instrument that in turn can mutate the behavior of the electronic sounds together with the mixer performer. I have dubbed this live electroacoustic system/process as ‘Instrumentalist and Mixer Feedback Transmutation’ (IMFT).},

  abstract = {Modular Mechanical Systems (MMS) is a study of DIY handmade electronic music systems utilising light sensors and kinetic movement as audio and control sources. It explores tactile feedback systems where performance gestures and light control and reception enable cyclical sonic motifs. Rotating frames are mounted on bearings/motors that support panels of coloured acrylic that function as light filters. Below this, embedded into the surface, are photocells routed to bespoke circuitry based on the 40106 CMOS IC and 6N138 optocoupler. Thus, the initial soundworld is generated via standalone synthesisers that are tangible (performed via rotation by hand and motor) and highly responsive/performable via light. A range of complimentary MIDI controllers with computer-controlled LEDs and accelerometers are used to process and augment the other boxes. The modular design allows an infinite array of potential performance outcomes. MMS considers how each element–hardware and software, tangible and virtual–of the system can both enact and respond to generative processes through gestural control and light manipulation. The authors explore the role and affordances of each element and how it contributes towards the temporal sonic and visual space. This question arises during both the design and interactive performance. During performance, the authors explore shifting timbres, rhythms, and recurring sonic motifs by manipulating the boxes' configuration and their relationship to one another as well as light positions and filters. The interplay of emerging textures with the performers' responsiveness and interaction highlights the affordances of handmade bespoke systems toward musical structures in non-linear systems. While improvisation and experimentation are at the heart of the composition process, the system allows for curated and repeatable performance outcomes.},

Rummaging is a practice centred around using the hands and a box of found objects to make noise. Our hybrid-rummaging expands this practice, seeking to explore how rummaging as a paradigm might be applied at every level of our performance ecology. We work with a range of technologies, from RFID, Bluetooth and video-tracking to tilt switches, electromagnetism and raw voltages, investigating how rummaging might be interfaced with these technologies, and the ways in which the technologies themselves might be appropriated, plundered and rummaged. We believe our practice enables us to speak to fundamental issues in NIME and explore them in performance, matters such as the relationships between gesture and sound, different forms of materiality, and the sense we can give to concepts such as ‘interface’, ‘instrument’ and ‘expression’. Our approach to hybridism differs from many approaches that can be found in NIME. We do not translate one form of materiality into another. We do not get different materials or actions on them to relate via abstraction or representation. Rather, we treat all objects at the same level, a truly flat ontology in which things, our hands included, collide. Our work is, in some respects, a boundary condition for NIME research and performance that we hope will provoke reflection on these and other affairs: it’s all stuff in a box.},

The transgressive nature of this performance derives from the conceptualisation of neurofeedback as a process that induces negative cognitive consequences, by means of a ‘provocative’ audio-visual performance ecology the performer is both a passive mediator and subject to; engendered via cascading digital ‘provocative' systems established within Max/MSP. The performance leverages, and assigns primacy towards, the artist/performers autistic cognition; a particularly idiosyncratic and revealing interface for performance and musical expression which can serve to auto-ethnographically evoke and deconstruct the systemically debilitating socio-economic constructs and metanarratives of the social model of disability, represented by the provocative performance ecology, that disempower members of the autistic and wider disability community.},
