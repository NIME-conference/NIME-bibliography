  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to define the process of iterative interface design as it pertains to musical performance. Embodying this design approach, the Monome OSC/MIDI USB controller represents a minimalist, open-source hardware device. The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of Monome users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device's original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs. }

At the same time, various types of electronic musical instruments have been developed. Since the main purpose of conventional electronic instruments is to duplicate the shape of acoustic instruments with no change in their hardware configuration, the diapason and the performance style of each instrument is inflexible. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct the UnitInstrument that consists of various types of musical units. A unit is constructed by simulating functional elements of conventional musical instruments, such as output timing of sound and pitch decision. Each unit has connectors for connecting other units to create various types of musical instruments. Additionally, we propose a language for easily and flexibly describing the settings of units. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed system by using it in actual performances.}

  abstract = {With the author’s own experiences in mind, this paper argues that, when used to amplify musical instruments or to play back other sonic material to an audience, loudspeakers and the technology that drives them, can be considered as a musical instrument. Particularly in situations with acoustic instruments this perspective can provide insight into the often cumbersome relation between the –technology orientated– sound engineer and the –music orientated– performer. Playing a musical instrument (whether acoustic, electric or electronic) involves navigating often complicated but very precise interfaces. The interface for sound amplification technology in a certain environment is not limited to the control surface of a mixing desk but includes the interaction with other stakeholder, i.e. the performers and the choice of loudspeakers and microphones and their positions. As such this interface can be as accurate and intimate but also as complicated as the interfaces of 'normal' musical instruments. By zooming in on differences between acoustic and electronic sources a step is taken towards inclusion in this discussion of the perception of amplified music and the possible influence of that amplification on performance practise.}

Generation of audible sound by self-demodulation of an ultrasound signal during its propagation through air; 2. The condensation of the ultrasound energy in one spatial point generating a precise tactile reproduction of the audible sound; and 3. The feed-forward method enabling a real-time intervention of the musician, by shaping the tactile (ultra)sound directly with his hands.}

Unfortunately, the relationship between plate shape and tone iscomplex, which makes it difficult to design plates with arbitrary shapes. Our system addresses this problem by runninga concurrent numerical eigenanalysis during interactive geometry editing. It continuously presents a predicted tone tothe user with both visual and audio feedback, thus makingit possible to design a plate with any desired shape and tone.We developed this system to demonstrate the effectivenessof integrating real-time finite element method analysis intogeometric editing to facilitate the design of custom-mademusical instruments. An informal study demonstrated theability of technically unsophisticated user to apply the system to complex metallophone design.}

We collected many ideas from currently available music programming languages and librariesto design and create the new capabilities in Minim. Thebasic mechanisms include chained unit generators, instruments, and notes. In general, one "patches" unit generators(for example, oscillators, delays, and envelopes) together inorder to create synthesis algorithms. These algorithms canthen either create continuous sound, or be used in instruments to play notes with specific start time and duration.We have written a base set of unit generators to enablea wide variety of synthesis options, and the capabilities ofthe unit generators, instruments, and Processing allow fora wide range of composition techniques.}

Our preliminary study investigates the non-verbal strategies employed for negotiation of our capacity for action with other bodies and the surrounding space through body-to-body and body-to-space couplings enabled by sensory supplementation devices. We employed a lowfi rapid prototyping approach to build this device, enabling distal perception by sonic and haptic feedback. Further, we conducted a workshop in which participants equipped with this device engaged in game-like activities. }

The interface of the Device Server allows users to see how devices are assigned to application functionalities, alter these assignments and save them into configuration files for later use. Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts to homogenize the appearance of different control signals to applications so that users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities and easily experiment with different control configurations.}

First, as a proof of concept, we report on the findings of an initial on-line survey among 37 musicians and 32 non-musicians evaluating the feasibility and validity of our approach. We show that our representation is understandable and that there are no significant differences between musicians and non-musicians. Second, we evaluated the approach in a real world scenario based on a Skype plug-in. In a field study with 14 participants we showed that sonified text messages strongly impact on the users’ message checking behavior by significantly reducing the time between receiving and reading an incoming message.}

Our new work epi-thet gathers data from individual interactions with common microscopes placed on platforms within a large space. This data is correlated with public domain genetic datasets obtained from micro-array analysis. A sonification algorithm generates unique compositions associated with the spectator "as measured" through their individual specification in performing an iconic measurement action. The apparatus is a receptacle for unique compositions in sound, and invites a participatory choreography of stillness that is available for reception as a live musical performance. }

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a wireless musical interface driven by grasping forces and human motion. The sounds generated by the traditional digital musical instruments are dependent on the physical shape of the musical instruments. The freedom of the musical performance is restricted by its structure. Therefore, the sounds cannot be generated with the body expression like the dance. We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance. }

To do this requires a deep consideration of the space of musical actions, so as to explicate what opposition should constitute, and machine listening technology (most prominently represented by new online beat and stream tracking algorithms) which gives an accurate measurement of player position so as to consistently avoid it. An initial pilot evaluation was undertaken, feeding back critical data to the developing design.}

This paper presents an interface that is designed to liberate the composer from thinking of spatialised sound as points in space. Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time. }

This paper presents a semi-automatic meta-modeling tool called the Instrumentalizer for embedding arbitrary synthesis algorithms in a control structure that exposes traditional instrument controls for pitch and expression. }

In this paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips.

Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control. }

These lead to the design of a gesture-controlled instrument that allows players to "bounce" sounds, "throw" them to other players, and compete in a game to "knock out" others' sounds. We composed the piece SoundBounce based on these interactions, and note that audiences seem to find performances of the piece accessible and engaging, perhaps due to the visibility of the metaphor. }

Force sensing resistors can offer good dynamic resolution but this technology is not currently offered in commodity devices and proper coupling of the sensor with the applied impact is difficult. }

Glitch DeLighter uses ordinary lighters as physical controllers that can be played by creating a flame and moving it in the air. Droned sounds are played by sustaining the flame and beats by generating sparks and fast flames. The pitch of every sound can be changed moving the flame vertically in the air. This is achieved by using a custom computer vision system as an interface which maps the real-time the data extracted from the flame and transmits those parameters to the sound generator. As a result, the flame visual dynamics are deeply connected to the aural perception of the sound - ‘the sound seems to be burning’. This process establishes a metaphor dramaturgically engaging for an audience. This paper contextualizes the glitch music aesthetics, prior research, the design and development of the instrument and reports on Burning The Sound– the first music composition created and performed with the instrument (by the author).}

Arguing that it is necessary to encounter resistances for achieving expression, it is suggested that new instrumental development ought to reflect on the concern for keeping the natural connections of live performances. }

  abstract = {This paper presents a virtual violin for real-time performances consisting of two modules: a violin spectral model and a control interface. The interface is composed by a sensing bow and a tube with drawn strings in substitution of a real violin. The spectral model is driven by the bowing controls captured with the control interface and it is able to predict spectral envelopes of the sound corresponding to those controls. The envelopes are filled with harmonic andnoisy content and given to an additive synthesizer in order to produce violin sounds. The sensing system is based on two motion trackers with 6 degrees of freedom. One tracker is attached to the bow and the other to the tube. Bowing controls are computed after a calibration process where the position of virtual strings and the hair-ribbon of the bowis obtained. A real time implementation was developed asa MAX/MSP patch with external objects for each of the modules.}

V.P. solves this problem by introducing heuristics of conducting an orchestra in detecting beats, applying rules regarding the tempo expression in a bar, etc. We confirmed with users that the system realized a high "following" performance and had musical persuasiveness. }

This foamchanges electrical resistance when deformed; the controllerworks by measuring resistance at multiple points in a single piece of foam in order to track its shape. These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences. Thecontroller achieves its aim of enabling intuitive interaction,but in terms of nuanced interaction, accuracy and repeatability were issues for some participants. It's not clear fromthe short evaluation study whether these issues would improve with practice, a longitudinal study that gives musicians time to practice and find the creative limitations ofthe controller would help to evaluate this fully.The evaluation highlighted interesting issues concerningthe high level nature of malleable control and different approaches to sonic exploration.}

A significant attribute of my Fuzzy Logic method is that it traces the trajectory of all musical details, since it is both the individual elements and their combination over time which is significant to the effectiveness of a musical work in achieving its goals. The goal of this work is to find a set of elements and rules, which will ultimately enable the construction of a genralised algorithmic compositional system which can produce expressive music if so desired. }

This time interval may include one or more touches. The problem is complicated by the fact that the mechanical interaction between the arm and piano action generates additional movements that are not under direct control of the player.

Our implementations privilege syncretic systems allowing one to explore combinations(hybrids) of disparate elements of a data set through theirplacement in a 2-D space. The first approach allows for theplacement of data points anywhere on the plane accordingto an anticipated performance strategy. The contribution(weight) of each data point varies according to a power function of the distance from the control cursor. The secondapproach uses constrained vertex colored triangulations ofmanifolds with labels placed at the vertices of triangulartiles. Weights are computed by barycentric projection ofthe control cursor position.}

The precision, speed, and efficiency of the system enable the sonification of hand gestures in realtime without the need to attach any physical devices to the performer's body.

Mmmmm is designed so that the DJ can utilize handgestures and haptic feedback to help them perform the various tasks involved in DJing (mixing, applying effects, andetc). This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an Ambient Tempo Detection mode in which the phones camera is utilized to detect the amount of movement in the environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that should be played. This mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on their performance. The DJ canchoose to utilize these modes of interaction and performance or utilize traditional DJ controls using MmmmmsN900 touch screen based graphics user interface.}

Various sensors and hardware are attached to the body and transmit signals to a workstation, where they are processed using Max/MSP. The game is divided into three levels, each of a different soundscape. The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player's focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state. The system is currently viewed as an interactive installation piece, but future iterations have potential applications in music therapy, bio games, extended performance art, and as a prototype for new interfaces for musical expression. }

We have a particular interest in embodied, embedded systems for vocal performance enhancement and transformation.

Engineering details to accompany a demonstration of recent prototypes are presented, highlighting a novel magnetostrictive flextensional transducer.

This design hypothesis is contextualised and assessed within the Sandbox#n series of bass+laptop meta-instruments, and the authors describe technical means of the implementation through the use of the open-source CataRT CBCS system adapted for live mosaicing.

When used in a musical context, the performer can leverage the physical reconfiguration of the device to affect the method of playing and ultimately the sound produced. We describe the implementation of the sensing system, along with a range of mapping techniques used to transform the sensor data into musical output, including both the direct synthesis of sound and also the generation of MIDI data for use with Ableton Live.

The noted experimental composer John Cage believed that the artist’s role in composition should be one of coexistence, as opposed to the traditional view of directly controlling the process. Consequently, Cage devel- oped methods of composing that upheld this philosophy by utilizing musical charts and the I Ching, also known as the Chinese Book of Changes. This project investigates these methods and models them via an interactive computer system to explore the use of modern interfaces in experimental composition.}

We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument. }

In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone. }
