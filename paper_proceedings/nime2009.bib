  abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation and comparison of four input devices for percussion tasks: a standard tom drum, Roland V-Drum, and two established examples of gestural controllers: the Buchla Lightning II, and the Radio Baton. The primary goal of this study was to determine how players' actions changed when moving from an acoustic instrument like the tom drum, to a gestural controller like the Buchla Lightning, which bears little resemblance to an acoustic percussion instrument. Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject's hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects' timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented. }

This paper presents an evaluation of several force renderings for target acquisition in space when used to support a music related task. The study presented here addresses only one musical aspect: the need to repeat elements accurately in time and in content. Several force scenarios will be rendered over a simple 3D target acquisition task and users' performance will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The results show how the users' subjective preference for a particular kind of force support does not always correlate to a quantitative measurement of performance enhancement. We describe a way in which a control mapping for a musical interface could be achieved without contradicting the users' preferences as obtained from the study. }

Gestures are transformed into electronic signals by sensors. Powered Suit is another suit that a dancer wears, but gestures are generated by motors. This is a sort of wearable robot. Second Life is software that is developed by Linden Lab. It allows creating a virtual world and a virtual human (avatar) in Internet. Working together with BodySuit, Powered Suit, and Second Life the idea behind the system is that a human body is augmented by electronic signals and is reflected in a virtual world in order to be able to perform interactively. }

A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping, clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra is a fusion system of the design of a performer and the emergence of cellular automata as a complex system. }

As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians. }

This paper discusses this conversion of the common motor motion of handwriting into an innovative form of music expression. The presented example instrument can be used to integrate the composing aspect of music with painting and writing, creating a new art form from the resultant aural and visual representation of the collaborative performing process. }

Existing tabletop instruments (and digital instruments in general) tend to impose either a steep learning curve on novice players or a frustrating ceiling of expressivity upon experts. We introduce WallBalls, an intuitive tabletop instrument designed to support both novice and expert performance. At first glance, WallBalls resembles a toy, game or whimsical sketchpad, but it quickly reveals itself as a deeply expressive and highly adaptable sample-based instrument capable of facilitating a startling variety of collaborative sound art.}

The Tactus is an expandable and inexpensive musical interface for the creation of loop-based music inspired by the Bubblegum Sequencer [2]. An optical camera, coupled with a computer running Max/MSP/Jitter can turn almost any matrix-like object into a step sequencer. The empty cells in the gridded object are filled with a fitting, colored object; the placement of which is analogous to adding an instrument or switching on a box in a step sequencer grid. The color and column position of every element in the matrix are used as parameters for a synthesizer while the row position of that element corresponds to the moment within the loop that entry is sounded. The two dimensional array can be positioned anywhere within the camera's visibility. Both the translation and rotation of the physical matrix are assigned to global parameters that affect the music while preserving the color and order of the cells. A rotation of 180 degrees, for example, will not reverse the sequence, but instead change an assigned global parameter.}

First, we catalog instruments related to the Kalichord.

The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on the instrument's body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely used in the acoustic instrumentalpraxis. They yield a strong potential for providing anextended soundscape via instrument augmentation, directlycontrolled by the musician through haptic manipulation ofthe instrument itself.

In addition, since a conductor normally does not look at a screenwhile conducting, tones are played to represent a certainbeat in a conducting gesture. Further, the system can be controlled entirely with the baton, removing the need to switchfrom baton to mouse. The interface is intended to be usedfor pedagogy purposes.}

It also loads a plugin code module that acts as a composition. A plugin maps pieces and relationships on the board, such as support or attack relationships, to a timed sequence of notes and accents. The server transmits notes in a sequence to an audio renderer process via network datagrams. Two players can perform a composition by playing chess, and a player can improvise by adjusting a plugin's music mapping parameters via a graphical user interface. A composer can create a new composition by writing a new plugin that uses a distinct algorithm for mapping game rules and states to music. A composer can also write a new note-to-sound mapping program in the audio renderer language. This software is available at http://faculty.kutztown.edu/parson/music/ParsonMusic.html. }

To improve the assistance, we augment the interface with programmed detents so that the musician can feelthe locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, themusician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such asglissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various formsof haptic detents, including fixed detent levels and forcesensitive detent levels. Preliminary results from a subjecttest confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection broughtabout by detents.}

Like the piano keyboard, the velocity of a player's impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon in Canberra. }

Instrumentalists come to the question of interactivity with a whole array of gestures, sounds and associations already in place, so must choose carefully the means by which the instrumental performance is augmented. Frances-Marie Uitti [2] is a pioneer in the field, creating techniques to amplify the cellist’s innate performative gestures and in parallel developing the instrument. This paper intends to give an overview of the author’s work in developing interactivity in piano performance, mechanical augmentation of the piano and possible structural developments of the instrument to bring it into the twenty-first century.}

  abstract = {The Double Slide Controller is a new electronic music instrument that departs from the slide trombone as a model for its design. Going much beyond a mere simulation of its acoustic counterpart it introduces truly innovative features: two powerful and versatile sets of gesture driven interfaces actuated by the hands of the performer, as well as featuring two independent slides, one for each hand/arm of the musician. The combination of these features make this instrument a great tool to explore new venues in musical expression, given the many degrees of technical and musical complexity that can be achieved during its performance.}

  abstract = {When we asked a colleague of ours why people do not make more haptic musical instruments, he replied that he thought they were “too hard to program and too expensive.” We decided to solve these perceived problems by introducing HSP, a simple platform for implementing haptic musical instruments. HSP obviates the need for employing low-level embedded control software because the haptic device is controlled directly from within the Pure Data (Pd) software running on a general purpose computer. Positions can be read from the haptic device, and forces can be written to the device using messages in Pd. Various additional objects have been created to facilitate rapid prototyping of useful haptic musical instruments in Pd. HSP operates under Linux, OS X, and Windows and supports the mass-produced Falcon haptic device from NovInt, which can currently be obtained for as little as US\$150. All of the above make HSP an especially excellent choice for pedagogical environments where multiple workstations are required and example programs should be complete yet simple.}

Thirdly, the practical ways in which a composer can use Versum to make his own audiovisual compositions are presented by means of a more detailed description of the different graphical user interface elements. Fourthly, a short description is given of the modular structure of the software underlying Versum. Finally, several foresights regarding the directions in which Versum will continue to develop in the near future are presented. }

Using ForTouch, a user can speak using hand gestures mapped to synthetic sound using a mapping function that preserves gesture trajectories. By making ForTouch portable and self-contained, speakers can communicate with others in the community and perform in new music/theatre stage productions. Figure 1 shows one performer using the ForTouch. ForTouch performers also allow us to study the relation between gestures and speech/song production.}
