Thecore of this proposed controller design is a continuouselectronic tonehole-sensing arrangement, equally applicableto other woodwind interfaces like those of the flute, recorder orJapanese shakuhachi. The controller will initially be used todrive a physically-based synthesis model, with the eventualgoal being the development of a mapping layer allowing theEpipE interface to operate as a MIDI-like controller of arbitrarysynthesis models.}

  abstract = {HyperPuja is a novel controller that closely mimicks the behavior of a Tibetan Singing Bowl rubbed with a "puja" stick. Our design hides the electronics from the performer to maintain the original look and feel of the instrument and the performance. This is achieved by using wireless technology to keep the stick un-tethered as well as burying the electronics inside the the core of the stick. The measured parameters closely resemble the input parameters of a related physical synthesis model allowing for convenient mapping of sensor parameters to synthesis input. The new controller allows for flexible choice of sound synthesis while fully maintaining the characteristics of the physical interaction of the original instrument.}

The score follower that we developed at Ircam is based on a Hidden Markov Model and on the modeling of the expected signal received from the performer. The model has been implemented in an audio and a Midi version, and is now being used in production. We report here our first experiences and our first steps towards a complete evaluation of system performances. Finally, we indicate directions how score following can go beyond the artistic applications known today.}

I have produced many types of interfaces, not only with physical/electrical sensors but also with biological/physiological sensors. This paper is intended as an investigation of some special approaches: (1) 16-channel electromyogram sensor called “MiniBioMuse-III” and its application work called “BioCosmicStorm-II” performed in Paris, Kassel and Hamburg in 2001, (2) sensing/reacting with “breathing” in performing arts, (3) 8-channel electric-feedback system and its experiments of “body-hearing sounds” and “body-listening to music”.}

These serve to provide the user with gestural controllers whilst in addition giving tactile feedback to the user. Cymatic virtual instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in a manner that is highly intuitive. Users design and play these virtual instruments by interacting directly with their physical shape and structure in terms of the physical properties of basic objects such as strings, membranes and solids which can be interconnected to form complex structures. The virtual instrument can be excited at any point mass by the following: bowing, plucking, striking, sine/square/sawtooth/random waveform, or an external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any point masses to deliver the acoustic output. This paper describes the underlying structure and principles upon which Cymatic is based, and illustrates its acoustic output.}

The modal parameters describe the linear response of a virtual vibrating solid, which is played as a musical instrument by a separate interface. The system uses a three layer feedforward backpropagation neural network which is trained by a discrete set of input-output examples. After training, the network extends the training set, which functions as the specification by example of the controller, to a continuous mapping allowing the real-time morphing of synthetic sound models.  We have implemented a prototype application using a controller which collects data from a hand-drawn digital picture. The virtual instrument consists of a bank of modal resonators whose frequencies, dampings, and gains are the parameters we control. We train the system by providing pictorial representations of physical objects such as a bell or a lamp, and associate high quality modal models obtained from measurements on real objects with these inputs. After training, the user can draw pictures interactively and “play” modal models which provide interesting (though unrealistic) interpolations of the models from the training set in real-time.}

We believe that the versatility of conventional musical instruments causes difficulty in performance. By dynamically specializing a musical instrument for performing a specific (genre of) piece, the musical instrument could become more useful for performing the piece and facilitates expressive performance. Based on this idea, we developed two new types of musical instruments, i.e., a "given-melody-based musical instrument" and a "harmonic-function-based musical instrument". From the experimental results using two prototypes, we demonstrate the efficiency of the design principle.}

The model presented heredistinguishes gestural primitives from units of measure ofgestures. The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.}
