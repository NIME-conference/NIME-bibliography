In this paper we describe our work towards aninstrument for percussion synthesis, in which a waveguidemesh is both excited and damped by a 2D matrix of forcesfrom a sensor. By emulating a drum skin both as controllerand sound generator, our instrument has reproduced someof the expressive qualities of hand drumming. Details of ourimplementation are discussed, as well as qualitative resultsand experience gleaned from live performances.}

In order to evaluate the creative use of physical models, a test was performed using 11 experienced musicians as test subjects. Results show that the capability of combining the physical models and the use of a physical interface engaged the musicians in creative exploration of physical models.}

It is based on a complex physical model of the vibrating plate --- the source of sound in the majority of percussion instruments. A Xilinx Virtex II pro FPGA core handles the sound synthesis computations with an 8 billion operations per second performance and has been designed in such a way to allow a high level of control and flexibility. Strategies are also presented to that allow the parametric space of the model to be mapped to the playing gestures of the percussionist.}

  abstract = {Musical performers need to show off their virtuosity for selfexpression and communicate with other people. Therefore, they are prepared to perform at any time and anywhere. However, a musical keyboard of 88 keys is too large and too heavy to carry around. When a portable keyboard that is suitable for carrying around is played over a wide range, the notes being played frequently cause the diapason of the keyboard to protrude. It is common to use Key Transpose in conventional portable keyboards, which shifts the diapason of the keyboard. However, this function creates several problems such as the feeling of discomfort from the misalignment between the keying positions and their output sounds. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct Mobile Clavier, which enables the diapason to be changed smoothly. Mobile Clavier resolves the problems with Key Transpose by having black keys inserted between any two side-by-side white keys. This paper also discusses how effective Mobile Clavier was in an experiment conducted using professional pianists. We can play music at any time and anywhere with Mobile Clavier.}

At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc. }

As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies. }

  abstract = {This paper presents two main ideas: (1) Various newly invented liquid-based or underwater musical instruments are proposed that function like woodwind instruments but use water instead of air. These “woodwater” instruments expand the space of known instruments to include all three states of matter: solid (strings, percussion); liquid (the proposed instruments); and gas (brass and woodwinds). Instruments that use the fourth state of matter (plasma) are also proposed. (2) Although the current trend in musical interfaces has been to expand versatililty and generality by separating the interface from the sound-producing medium, this paper identifies an opposite trend in musical interface design inspired by instruments such as the harp, the acoustic or electric guitar, the tin whistle, and the Neanderthal flute, that have a directness of user-interface, where the fingers of the musician are in direct physical contact with the sound-producing medium. The newly invented instruments are thus designed to have this sensually tempting intimacy not be lost behind layers of abstraction, while also allowing for the high degree of virtuosity. Examples presented include the poseidophone, an instrument made from an array of ripple tanks, each tuned for a particular note, and the hydraulophone, an instrument in which sound is produced by pressurized hydraulic fluid that is in direct physical contact with the fingers of the player. Instruments based on these primordial media tend to fall outside existing classifications and taxonomies of known musical instruments which only consider instruments that make sound with solid or gaseous states of matter. To better understand and contextualize some of the new primordial user interfaces, a broader concept of musical instrument classification is proposed that considers the states of matter of both the user-interface and the sound production medium.}

The paper is divided into conceptual and technological parts. We first describe the project’s dramaturgical and conceptual context in order to situate the artistic framework that has guided the technological system design. Specifically, this framework discusses the team’s approach in combining techniques from situated computing, theatrical sound design practice and dynamical systems in order to create a new kind of adaptive audio scenographic environment augmented by wireless, distributed sensing for use in live theatrical performance. The goal of this adaptive sound design is to move beyond both existing playback models used in theatre sound as well as the purely humancentered, controller-instrument approach used in much current interactive performance practice.}

It incorporates an adaptive mechanism that utilizes a measure of engagement to inform ongoing audio patterns in response to human activity. By identifying engaging features in its response, the system is able to predict, pre-empt and shape its evolving responses in accordance with the most engaging, compelling, interesting attributes of the active environment. An implementation of ParticleTecture for gallery installation is presented and discussed as one form of architectural space.}

Given itsgeneric network ability (eg., being an 802.11a/b/g device) there istheoretically no limit to the number of WISEAR boxes that canbe used simultaneously in a performance, facilitating multiperformer compositions.

A framewise chroma distribution over an entire musical piece is a useful and straightforward representation of its musical pitch over time.

Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion. }

That is, a given keypress will sound a pitch a number of steps away from the last note sounded (within the key signature and scale selected) according to the 'delta' value assigned to that key. The advantages of such a system are convenience, speed, and the ability to play difficult, unusual and/or unintended passages extemporaneously. }

The ColorDex system employs a completely new operational metaphor which allows the mix DJ to prepare up to six tracks at once, and perform mixes between up to three of those at a time. The basic premises of the design are: 1) Build a performance tool that multiplies the possible choices a DJ has in respect in how and when tracks are prepared and mixed; 2) Design the system in such a way that the tool does not overload the performer with unnecessary complexity, and 3) Make use of novel technology to make the performance of live music mixing more engaging for both the performer and the audience. The core components of the system are: A software program to load, visualize and playback digitally encoded tracks; the HDDJ device (built chiefly out of a repurposed hard disk drive), which provides tactile manipulation of the playback speed and position of tracks; and the Cubic Crossfader, a wireless sensor cube that controls of the volume of individual tracks, and allows the DJ to mix these in interesting ways. }

We use sensors to measure the strip’s curvature and reconstruct its shape as a wavetable stored in a computer. This provides a direct gestural mapping from the shape of the WaveSaw to the timbral characteristics of the computer-generated sound. Additional sensors provide control of pitch, amplitude, and other musical parameters.}

A user-interface receives input from a generic gesture interface (such as a NIME device) and interprets them as ITD cues. Trajectories provided by these signals are used as Target Sets of an evolutionary algorithm. A Fitness procedure optimizes locally the distance between the Target Set and the SSG pairs.

This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum, the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs. Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.}

These avenues of exploration include: mappings of spectral data directly into notated music, the creation of software transcribers that enable users to generate multiple realizations of algorithmic compositions, and new types of spontaneous performance with live generated screen-based music notation. The authors present their existing software tools along with suggestions for future research and artistic inquiry. }

The techniques for rendering acoustic events on multi-speaker or headphone-based surround systems have evolved considerably, making it possible to use them in real-time performances on light equipment. Controlling the placement of sound sources is usually done in idiosyncratic ways and has not yet been fully explored and formalized. This issue is addressed here with the proposition of a methodical approach. The mapping of gestures to source motion is implemented by giving the sources physical object properties and manipulating these characteristics with standard geometrical transforms through hierarchical or emergent relationships. }

We explore several options for characterizing improvisation at a higher level, and managing decisions for interactive performance in a rich timbral environment. We developed a simple, efficient framework using a small number of features suggested by recent work in mood modeling in music. We describe and evaluate the first version of the IMC, which was used in performance at the Live Algorithms for Music (LAM) conference in December 2006. We touch on developments on the system since LAM, and discuss future plans to address perceived shortcomings in responsiveness, and the ability of the system to make long-term adaptations. }

Yet, there is room for more complex and interesting sonification schemes that can improve the sensation of presence in a Virtual Environment. In this paper we propose a system that automatically generates original background music in real-time called VR-RoBoser. As a test case we present the application of VR-RoBoser to a dynamic avatar that explores its environment. We show that the musical events are directly and continuously generated and influenced by the behavior of the avatar in three-dimensional virtual space, generating a context dependent sonification. }

These HIDs are ubiquitous, inexpensive and capable of sensing a wide range of human gesture, making them appealing interfaces for interactive media control. However, it is difficult to utilize many of these devices for custom-made applications, particularly for novices. The modules we discuss in this paper are [hidio], which handles incoming and outgoing data between a patch and a HID, and [input noticer], which monitors HID plug/unplug events. The goal in creating these modules is to preserve maximal flexibility in accessing the input and output capabilities of HIDs, in a manner that is ap- proachable for both sophisticated and beginning designers. This paper documents our design notes and implementa- tion considerations, current progress, and ideas for future extensions to the HID toolkit.}
