  abstract = {The Overtone Fiddle is a new violin-family instrument that incorporates electronic sensors, integrated DSP, and physical actuation of the acoustic body. An embedded tactile sound transducer creates extra vibrations in the body of the Overtone Fiddle, allowing performer control and sensation via both traditional violin techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared man/machine control of the resulting sound. A magnetic pickup system is mounted to the end of the fiddle's fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded in the body of the instrument back to the pickup. }

Unfortunately, they tend to be costly and often suffer from two drawbacks for music performance:(1) relatively high latency owing to their sensing mechanism, and (2) lack of haptic feedback. We analyze the latency present in several current multi-touch platforms, and we describe a new custom system that reduces latency to an average of 30 ms while providing programmable haptic feed-back to the user. The paper concludes with a description of ongoing and future work.}

The first of its kind, Elektrika consists of seven instruments acting as MIDI controllers accompanied by traditional percussion and played by 11 or more performers following Balinese performance practice. Three main percussive instrument designs were executed using a combination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original, the sound andt ravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyond the quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds. It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taught tradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creating opportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar's enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness in Balinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles, ElekTrika challenges performers to trust silent instruments and develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, but through the sound of the whole.}

Being simpler in structure and easier to implement than typical ultrasonic motion detectors with special transducers, this system is robust and offers precise results without introducing any undesired sonic disturbance to users. We describe the design and implementation of Sonicstrument, evaluate its performance, and present two practical applications of the system in music and interactive performance.}

  abstract = {Popular music (characterized by improvised instrumental parts, beat and measure-level organization, and steady tempo) poses challenges for human-computer music performance (HCMP). Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music performance by computer. }

Four forms of expressivity arising out of interactive work with the Bodycoder system will be identified. How sonic (electro-acoustic), programmed, gestural (kinaesonic) and in terms of the V'Oct(Ritual) vocal expressivities are constructed as pragmatic and tangible elements within the compositional practice will be discussed and the subsequent importance of collaboration with a performer will be exposed. }

Previousresearch points to a failure to balance complexity with usability, and a loss of transparency due to the detachmentof the controller and sound generator. The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience's lack of prior exposure to theinstrument and its workings.However, we argue that there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are intendedto be both a tool for creative expression and a creative workof art in themselves, resulting in incompatible requirements.By considering the instrument, the composition and theperformance together as a whole with careful considerationof the rate of learning demanded of the audience, we propose that a lack of transparency can become an asset ratherthan a hindrance. Our approach calls for not only controllerand sound generator to be designed in sympathy with eachother, but composition, performance and physical form too.Identifying three design principles, we illustrate this approach with the Serendiptichord, a wearable instrument fordancers created by the ,

Using the metaphor, weexplored the possibilities for recognizing of input gesturesand creating sonic events by mapping data to sound. Thus,four different types of Airer Choir were developed. By classifying the interfaces, we concluded that various musicalexpressions are possible by using the same metaphor.}

In all of the works, the EGGS principles of simplicity based on the correspondence between elementary sonic and movement units, and of organicity between sound and gesture are applied. Indeed, we study both sound as a means for gesture representation and gesture as embodiment of sound. These principles constitute our guidelines for the investigation of the bidirectional relationship between sound and body expression with various strategies involving both educated and non-educated executors. }

With the popularity of Consumer Generated Media, many beginners in term of art-creation are interested in creating their own original art works. Thus developing of useful IEC system for musical creation is an urgent task. However, user-assist functions for IEC proposed in pastworks decrease the possibility of getting good unexpected results, which is an important feature of art-creation with IEC. In this paper, The author proposes a new IEC evaluation process named "Shopping Basket" procedure IEC. In the procedure, an user-assist function called Similarity-Based Reasoning allows for natural evaluation by the user. The function reduces user's burden without reducing the possibility of unexpected results. The author performs an experiment where subjects use the new interface to validate it. As a result of the experiment, the author concludes that the new interface is better to motivate users to compose with IEC system than the old interface.}

Such qualities are the density of the generated events per bar, the amount of variation in generation, the amount of syncopation, the metrical strength, and of course the meter itself.

  abstract = {Audio mixing is the adjustment of relative volumes, panning and other parameters corresponding to different soundsources, in order to create a technically and aesthetically adequate sound sum. To do this, audio engineers employ "panpots" and faders, the standard controls in audio mixers. The design of such devices has remained practically unchanged for decades since their introduction. At the time,no usability studies seem to have been conducted on suchdevices, so one could question if they are really optimizedfor the task they are meant for.This paper proposes a new set of controls that might beused to simplify and/or improve the performance of audiomixing tasks, taking into account the spatial characteristicsof modern mixing technologies such as surround and 3Daudio and making use of multitouch interface technologies.A preliminary usability test has shown promising results.}

We discuss the creation and implementationof an automatic "supervisor", using unsupervised machinelearning algorithms to train a supervised neural networkon the fly. This hierarchical arrangement enables networktraining in real time based on the musical or gestural control inputs employed in a performance, aiming at freeing theperformer to operate in a creative, intuitive realm, makingthe machine control transparent and automatic. Three implementations of this self supervised model driven by iPod,iPad, and acoustic violin are described.}

This synthesizer generates music based on the kinetics of particles under a two-dimensional physics engine. The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction, restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated. A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone. However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment. }

The experiment is based onsound stimuli corresponding to "causal" and "non-causal" sounds. It is divided into a performance phase and an interview. The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the "causality" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds' causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that "mimic" a sound's cause and gestures that "trace" a sound'smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound "contours". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.}

However, most of the studies that use physiology based interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and its usage in collaborative scenarios is still in its beginning. In this paper we explore how interactive sonification of brain and heart signals, and its representation through physical objects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhance motivational and controlling aspects of music collaboration. A multimodal system is presented, based on an electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface. Performance and motivation variables were assessed in an experiment involving a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs of participants used two methods for sound creation: implicit interaction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The results showed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control than the Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it. These results support the feasibility of introducing physiology-based interaction in multimodal interfaces for collaborative music generation.}

Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document. }

To doso, however, an accelerometer/gyroscope–equipped smartphone is firmly attached to a modified record, placed on a turntable, and used to sense a performers movement, resulting in a wireless sensing-based scratching method. The accelerometer and gyroscope data is wirelessly transmitted to a computer to manipulate the digital audio playback in real-time. The method provides the benefit of digital audio and storage, requires minimal additional hardware, accommodates familiar proprioceptive feedback, and allows a single interface to control both digital and analog audio. In addition, the proposed method provides numerous additional benefits including real-time graphical display,multi-touch interaction, and untethered performance (e.g“air-scratching”). Such a method turns a vinyl record into an interactive surface and enhances traditional scratching performance by affording new and creative musical interactions. Informal testing show this approach to be viable,responsive, and robust.}

Perhaps the biggest challenge for LOs isthe distribution, management and control of software acrossheterogeneous collections of networked computers. Software must be stored and distributed from a central repository, but launched on individual laptops immediately beforeperformance. The GRENDL project leverages proven gridcomputing frameworks and approaches the Laptop Orchestra as a distributed computing platform for interactive computer music. This allows us to readily distribute softwareto each laptop in the orchestra depending on the laptop'sinternal configuration, its role in the composition, and theplayer assigned to that computer. Using the SAGA framework, GRENDL is able to distribute software and managesystem and application environments for each composition.Our latest version includes tangible control of the GRENDLenvironment for a more natural and familiar user experience.}

The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative music improvisation games towards ways of mutual play. }

The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance. In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing, sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia musical performance piece. }

The performance of the user is measured against a score that needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking.

Previous studies indicated simultaneous music listening and performance is difficult for non-musicians, and that visual support for the task might be helpful. This paper presents results from a preliminary user study conducted to evaluate the effect of visual feedback on a musical tracking task. Participants generated a musical signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter, but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously decreases performance in both dimensions. }

It is implemented efficiently by taking advantage of its inherent sparse matrix structure. The modulation matrix is used within the Hadron Particle Synthesizer, a complex granular module with 200 synthesis parameters and a simplified performance control structure with 4 expression parameters. }

In this paper, we first describe the system we developed to use this interface for sound generation and controlling musical expression. The skeleton data are extracted from users' motions and the data are translated to pre-defined MIDI data. We then use the MIDI data to control several applications. To allow the translation between the data, we implemented a simple Kinect-to-MIDI data convertor, which is introduced in this paper. We describe two applications to make music with Kinect: we first generate sound with Max/MSP, and then control the adlib with our own adlib generating system by the body movements of the users. }

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new research direction for the large family of instrumental musical interfaces where sound is generated using digital granular synthesis, and where interaction and control involve the (fine) operation of stiff, flat contact surfaces. First, within a historical context, a general absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda. }

We conducted a participatory design study that focused on the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a technology probe that connects users' hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically. }

We found thatintegrated vibrotactile feedback resulted in an increase inperformer engagement with the instrument, but resulted ina reduction in the perceived control of the instrument.

Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one's mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware. }

In this paper we present an interactive installation, where we expand the role of the instrument to motivate musicking and cocreation between diverse users. We have made an open installation, where users can perform a variety of actions in several situations. By using the abilities of the computer, we have made an installation, which can be interpreted to have many roles. It can both be an instrument, a co-musician, a communication partner, a toy, a meeting place and an ambient musical landscape. The users can dynamically shift between roles, based on their abilities, knowledge and motivation. }

This opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed atARTeM [2]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player, toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that would disturb the performer. Weused those sensors in several performances with a dancingviola player and in one where she was simultaneously controlling gas flames interactively. We are currently applyingthem to other types of musical performances.}

Through my background as a guitarist and composer in an experimental metal band I have experienced a vast development in music technology during the last 20 years. This development has made a great impact in changing the procedures for composing and producing music within my genre without necessarily changing the strategies of how the technology is used. The transition from analogue to digital sound technology not only opened up new ways of manipulating and manoeuvring sound, it also opened up challenges in how to integrate and control the digital sound technology as a seamless part of my musical genre. By using techniques and methods known from electro-acoustic/computer music, and adapting them for use within my tradition, this research aims to find new strategies for composing and producing music within my genre. }

Creating a multi-dimensional, expressive instrument was the primary driving force. For these criteria the pedal steel guitar proved an apt model as it allows control over several instrument parameters simultaneously and continuously. The parameters we wanted control over were volume, timbre, release time and pitch.The Quadrofeelia is played with two hands on a horizontal surface. Single notes and melodies are easily played as well as chordal accompaniment with a variety of timbres and release times enabling a range of legato and staccato notes in an intuitive manner with a new yet familiar interface.}
