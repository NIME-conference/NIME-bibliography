 abstract = {This paper discusses a quantitative method to evaluate whether an expert player is able to execute skilled actions on an unfamiliar interface while keeping the focus of their performance on the musical outcome rather than on the technology itself. In our study, twelve professional electric guitar players used an augmented plectrum to replicate prerecorded timbre variations in a set of musical excerpts. The task was undertaken in two experimental conditions: a reference condition, and a subtle gradual change in the sensitivity of the augmented plectrum which is designed to affect the guitarist’s performance without making them consciously aware of its effect. We propose that players’ subconscious response to the disruption of changing the sensitivity, as well as their overall ability to replicate the stimuli, may indicate the strength of the relationship they developed with the new interface. The case study presented in this paper highlights the strengths and limitations of this method.},

 abstract = {One of the consequences of the pandemic has been the potential to embrace hybrid support for different human group activities, including music performance, resulting in accommodating a wider range of situations. We believe that we are barely at the tip of the iceberg and that we can explore further the possibilities of the medium by promoting a more active role of the audience during telematic performance. In this paper, we present personic, a mobile web app designed for distributed audiences to constitute a digital musical instrument. This has the twofold purpose of letting the audience contribute to the performance with a non-intrusive and easy-to-use approach, as well as providing audiovisual feedback that is helpful for both the performers and the audience alike. The challenges and possibilities of this approach are discussed from pilot testing the app using a practice-based approach. We conclude by pointing to new directions of telematic performance, which is a promising direction for network music and digital performance.},

 abstract = {Physical modelling sound synthesis methods generate vast and intricate sound spaces that are navigated using meaningful parameters. Numerical based physical modelling synthesis methods provide authentic representations of the physics they model. Unfortunately, the application of these physical models are often limited because of their considerable computational requirements. In previous studies, the CPU has been shown to reliably support two-dimensional linear finite-difference models in real-time with resolutions up to 64x64. However, the near-ubiquitous parallel processing units known as GPUs have previously been used to process considerably larger resolutions, as high as 512x512 in real-time. GPU programming requires a low-level understanding of the architecture, which often imposes a barrier for entry for inexperienced practitioners. Therefore, this paper proposes HyperModels, a framework for automating the mapping of linear finite-difference based physical modelling synthesis into an optimised parallel form suitable for the GPU. An implementation of the design is then used to evaluate the objective performance of the framework by comparing the automated solution to manually developed equivalents. For the majority of the extensive performance profiling tests, the auto-generated programs were observed to perform only 60% slower but in the worst-case scenario it was 50% slower. The initial results suggests that, in most circumstances, the automation provided by the framework avoids the lowlevel expertise required to manually optimise the GPU, with only a small reduction in performance. However, there is still scope to improve the auto-generated optimisations. When comparing the performance of CPU to GPU equivalents, the parallel CPU version supports resolutions of up to 128x128 whilst the GPU continues to support higher resolutions up to 512x512. To conclude the paper, two instruments are developed using HyperModels based on established physical model designs.},

 abstract = {This paper explores a minimalist approach to live coding using a single input parameter to manipulate the graph structure of a finite state machine through a stream of bits. This constitutes an example of bottom-up live coding, which operates on a low level language to generate a high level structure output. Here we examine systematically how to apply mappings of continuous gestural interactions to develop a bottom-up system for predicting programming behaviours. We conducted a statistical analysis based on a controlled data generation procedure. The findings concur with the subjective experience of the behavior of the system when the user modulates the sampling frequency of a variable clock using a knob as an input device. This suggests that a sequential predictive model may be applied towards the development of a tactically predictive system according to Tanimoto’s hierarchy of liveness.

They are well suited to creative and expressive forms of HCI such as Digital Musical Interfaces (DMIs). However, research on the design of deformable DMIs is limited. This paper explores the role that deformable interfaces might play in DMI design. We conducted an online study with 23 DMI designers in which they were invited to create non-functional deformable DMIs together. Our results suggest forms of gestural input and sound mappings that deformable interfaces intuitively lend themselves to for DMI design. From our results, we highlight four styles of DMI that deformable interfaces might be most suited to, and suggest the kinds of experience that deformable DMIs might be most compelling for musicians and audiences. We discuss how DMI designers explore deformable materials and gestures input and the role of unexpected affordances in the design process.},

Musical expression has been a key driver of innovation in voicebased technologies, from traditional architectures that amplify singing to cutting-edge research in vocal synthesis.

Analyzing trends in Vocal NIMEs can help the community better understand common interests, identify uncharted territories, and explore directions for future research. We identified a corpus of 98 papers about Vocal NIMEs from 2001 to 2021, which we analyzed in 3 ways. First, we automatically extracted latent themes and possible categories using natural language processing. Taking inspiration from concepts surfaced through this process, we then defined several core dimensions with associated descriptors of Vocal NIMEs and assigned each paper relevant descriptors under each dimension. Finally, we defined a classification system, which we then used to uniquely and more precisely situate each paper on a map, taking into account the overall goals of each work. Based on our analyses, we present trends and challenges, including questions of gender and diversity in our community, and reflect on opportunities for future work.},

In an effort to remove the significant technical and financial barriers that laptops can present to performers looking to start their own group, this paper proposes a solution in the form of the Norns Shield, a computer music instrument (CMI) that requires minimal set-up and promotes immediate music-making to performers of all skill levels. Prior research centered on using alternative CMIs to supplant laptops in ensemble settings is discussed, and the benefits of adopting the Norns Shield in service of democratizing and diversifying the music technology ensemble are demonstrated in a discussion centered on the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley New Music Ensemble’s adoption of the instrument. A description of two software packages developed by the author showcases an extension of the instrument’s abilities to share collaborative control data between internet-enabled CMIs and to remotely manage script launching and parameter configuration across a group of Norns Shields, providing resources for ensembles interested in incorporating the device into their ranks.},

 abstract = {An emerging approach to building new musical instruments is based on training neural networks to generate audio conditioned upon parametric input. We use the term "generative models" rather than "musical instruments" for the trained networks because it reflects the statistical way the instruments are trained to "model" the association between parameters and the distribution of audio data, and because "musical" carries historical baggage as a reference to a restricted domain of sound. Generative models are musical instruments in that they produce a prescribed range of sound playable through the expressive manipulation of an interface. To learn the mapping from interface to audio, generative models require large amounts of parametrically labeled audio data. This paper introduces the Synthetic Audio Textures (Syn- Tex1) collection of data set generators. SynTex is a database of parameterized audio textures and a suite of tools for creating and labeling datasets designed for training and testing generative neural networks for parametrically conditioned sound synthesis. While there are many existing labeled speech and traditional musical instrument databases available for training generative models, most datasets of general (e.g. environmental) audio are oriented and labeled for the purpose of classification rather than expressive musical generation. SynTex is designed to provide an open shareable reference set of audio for creating generative sound models including their interfaces. SynTex sound sets are synthetically generated. This facilitates dense and accurate labeling necessary for conditionally training generative networks conditionally dependent on input parameter values. SynTex has several characteristics designed to support a data-centric approach to developing, exploring, training, and testing generative models.},

Existing violin-playing machines have faced various problems concerning performance techniques owing to constraints imposed by their design. Bowing and fingering that require accurate and high-acceleration movement (e.g., a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando) are essential but challenging. To overcome this problem, Ghost Play is equipped with seven electromagnetic linear actuators, three for controlling the bow (i.e., the right hand), and the other four for controlling the pitch on each string (i.e., the left hand). The violin-playing robot is mounted with an unmodified violin bow. A sensor is attached to the bow to measure bow pressure. The control software receives a time series of performance data and manipulates the actuators accordingly. The performance data consists of the bow direction, bow speed, bow pressure, pitch, vibrato interval, vibrato width, and string to be drawn. We also developed an authoring tool for the performance data using a graphic user interface. Finally, we demonstrated Ghost Play performing bowing and fingering techniques such as a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando, as well as a piece of classical music.},

 abstract = {Beginning, amateur, and professional violinists alike make use of a shoulder rest with a typical form factor for ergonomic support. Numerous commercial devices are available. We saturate these inert devices with electronics and actuators to open a new design space for “active shoulder rests” (ASRs), a pathway for violinists to adopt inexpensive and transparent electroacoustic interfaces. We present a dual-mode ASR that features a built-in microphone pickup and parametric control of mixing between sound diffusion and actuation modes for experiments with active acoustics and feedback. We document a modular approach to signal processing allowing quick adaptation and differentiation of control signals, and demonstrate rich sound processing techniques that create lively improvisation environments. By fostering participation and convergence among digital media practices and diverse musical cultures, we envision ASRs broadly rekindling creative practice for the violin, long a tool of improvisation before the triumph of classical works. ASRs decolonize the violin by activating new flows and connectivities, freeing up habitual relations, and refreshing the musical affordances of this otherwise quintessentially western and canonical instrument.},

 abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly being envisaged as a process of perceptual mediation or modulation, not only as a system that combines aligned and interactive virtual objects with a real environment. Within artistic practice, this reconceptualisation has led to a medium that emphasises this multisensory integration of virtual processes, leading to expressive, narrative-driven, and thought-provoking AR experiences. This paper outlines the development and evaluation of the polaris~ experience. polaris~ is built using a set of open-source hardware and software components that can be used to create privacy-respecting and cost-effective audiovisual AR experiences. Its wearable component is comprised of the open-source Project North Star AR headset and a pair of bone conduction headphones, providing simultaneous real and virtual visual and auditory elements. These elements are spatially aligned using Unity and PureData to the real space that they appear in and can be gesturally interacted with in a way that fosters artistic and musical expression. In order to evaluate the polaris~, 10 participants were recruited, who spent approximately 30 minutes each in the AR scene and were interviewed about their experience. Using grounded theory, the author extracted coded remarks from the transcriptions of these studies, that were then sorted into the categories of Sentiment, Learning, Adoption, Expression, and Immersion. In evaluating polaris~ it was found that the experience engaged participants fruitfully, with many noting their ability to express themselves audiovisually in creative ways. The experience and the framework the author used to create it is available in a Github respository.},

 abstract = {This paper presents the MappEMG pipeline. The goal of this pipeline is to augment the traditional classical concert experience by giving listeners access, through the sense of touch, to an intimate and non-visible dimension of the musicians’ bodily experience while performing. The live-stream pipeline produces vibrations based on muscle activity captured through surface electromyography (EMG). Therefore, MappEMG allows the audience to experience the performer’s muscle effort, an essential component of music performance which is typically unavailable to direct visual observation. The paper is divided in four sections. First, we overview related works on EMG, music performance, and vibrotactile feedback. We then present conceptual and methodological issues of capturing musicians’ muscle effort related to their expressive intentions. We further explain the different components of the live-stream data pipeline: a python software named Biosiglive for data acquisition and processing, a Max/MSP patch for data post-processing and mapping, and a mobile application named hAPPtiks for real-time control of smartphones’ vibration. Finally, we address the application of the pipeline in an actual music performance. Thanks to their modular structure, the tools presented could be used in different creative and biomedical contexts involving gestural control of haptic stimuli.},

 abstract = {Physical metaphor provides a visceral and universal logical framework for composing musical gestures. Physical simulations can aid composers in creating musical gestures based in complex physical metaphors. CHON (Coupled Harmonic Oscillator Network) is a new crossplatform application for composing musical gestures based in Newtonian physics. It simulates a network of particles connected by springs and sonifies the motion of individual particles. CHON is an interactive instrument that can provide complex yet tangible and physically grounded control data for synthesis, sound processing, and musical score generation. Composers often deploy dozens of independent LFOs to control various parameters in a DAW or synthesizer. By coupling numerous control signals together using physical principles, CHON represents an innovation on the traditional LFO model of musical control. Unlike independent LFOs, CHON’s signals push and pull on each other, creating a tangible causality in the resulting gestures. In this paper, I briefly describe the design of CHON and discuss its use in composition through examples in my own works.},

CAVI utilized a generative deep learning model that monitored muscle and motion data streamed from a Myo armband worn on the performer’s forearm. The generated control signals automated layered time-based effects modules and animated a virtual body representing the artificial agent. In the final performance, two expert musicians (a guitarist and a drummer) performed with CAVI.

In this paper, we take an autobiographical design approach to design a NIME in HMAR, exploring what is a genuine application of AR in a NIMEs and how AR mediates between the performer and sound as a creative expression. Three interface prototypes are created for a frequency modulation synthesis system. We report on their design process and our learning and experiences through self-usage and improvisation. Our designs explore free-hand and embodied interaction in our interfaces, and we reflect on how these unique qualities of HMAR contribute to an expressive medium for sonic creation.},

 abstract = {NIME has recently seen critique emerging around colonisation of music technology, and the need to decolonise digital audio workstations and music software. While commercial DAWs tend to sideline musical styles outside of western norms (and even many inside too), viewing this problem through an historical lens of imperialist legacies misses the influence of a more recent - and often invisible - hegemony that bears significant direct responsibility: The culture of technological development. In this paper we focus on the commercial technological development culture that produces these softwares, to better understand the more latent reasons why music production software ends up supporting some music practices while failing others. By using this lens we can more meaningfully separate the influence of historic cultural colonisation and music tech development culture, in order to better advocate for and implement meaningful change. We will discuss why the meaning of the term “decolonisation” should be carefully examined when addressing the limitations of DAWs, because while larger imperialist legacies continue to have significant impact on our understanding of culture, this can direct attention away from the techno-cultural subset of this hegemony that is actively engaged in making the decisions that shape the software we use. We discuss how the conventions of this techno-cultural hegemony shape the affordances of major DAWs (and thereby musical creativity). We also examine specific factors that impact decision making in developing and evolving typical music software alongside latent social structures, such as competing commercial demands, how standards are shaped, and the impact of those standards. Lastly, we suggest that, while we must continue to discuss the impact of imperialist legacies on the way we make music, understanding the techno-cultural subset of the colonial hegemony and its motives can create a space to advocate for conventions in music software that are more widely inclusive.},

However, in the context of spontaneous and heterogeneous orchestras, such as jam sessions, collective music-making may become challenging due to the diversity and complexity of the DMIs and the musicians’ unfamiliarity with the others’ instruments. In particular, the potential lack of visibility into each musician’s respective contribution to the sound they hear, i.e. who is playing what, might impede their capacity to play together. In this paper, we propose to augment each instrument in a digital orchestra with visual feedback extracted in real-time from the instrument’s activity, in order to increase this awareness. We present the results of a user study in which we investigate the influence of visualisation level and situational visibility during short improvisations by groups of three musicians.

We then discuss a case study, where we use the adapter to implement a new VR instrument that integrates the repelling force between neodymium magnets into the controllers. This allows us to imbue the virtual instrument, which is inherently devoid of tactility, with haptic feedback—-an essential affordance of many musical instruments.},

 abstract = {Automated processes in musical instruments can serve to free a performer from the physical and mental constraints of music performance, allowing them to expressively control more aspects of music simultaneously. Modular synthesis has been a prominent platform for exploring automation through the use of sequencers and has therefore fostered a tradition of user interface design utilizing increasingly complex abstraction methods. We investigate the history of sequencer design from this perspective and introduce machine learning as a potential source for a new type of intelligent abstraction. We then offer a case study based on this approach and present Latent Drummer, which is a prototype system dedicated to integrating machine learning-based interface abstractions into the tradition of sequencers for modular synthesis.},

The tutoring system fully utilizes the interactivity space in the auditory, visual, and haptic modalities, supporting seven haptic feedback modes and four visual feedback modes. The combinations of those modes form different cross-modal tasks of varying difficulties, allowing the curriculum to apply the “scaffolding then fading” educational technique to foster active learning and amortize cognitive load. We study the effect of multimodal instructions, guidance, and feedback using a qualitative pilot study with two subjects over ~11 hours of training with our tutoring system.

We conducted interviews with 6 artists who are engaged in movement-sound interactions: 1 performer, 1 performer/composer, 1 composer, 1 teacher/composer, 1 dancer/teacher, 1 dancer. Through a thematic analysis of the transcripts we identified three main themes related to (1) the mediating role of technological tools (2) usability and normativity, and (3) learning and practice. These results provide ground for discussion about the design and study of movementsound interactive systems.},

 abstract = {The Web MIDI API allows the Web browser to interact with hardware and software MIDI devices detected at the operating system level. This ability for the browser to interface with most electronic instruments made in the past 30 years offers significant opportunities to preserve, enhance or re-discover a rich musical and technical heritage. By including MIDI in the broaderWeb ecosystem, this API also opens endless possibilities to create music in a networked and socially engaging way. However, the Web MIDI API specification only offers low-level access to MIDI devices and messages. For instance, it does not provide semantics on top of the raw numerical messages exchanged between devices. This is likely to deter novice programmers and significantly slow down experienced programmers. After reviewing the usability of the bare Web MIDI API, the WEBMIDI. js JavaScript library was created to alleviate this situation. By decoding raw MIDI messages, encapsulating complicated processes and providing semantically significant objects, properties, methods and events, the library makes it easier to interface with MIDI devices from compatible browsers. This paper first looks at the context in which the specification was created and then discusses the usability improvements layered on top of the API by the opensource WEBMIDI.js library.},

We namely explore (i) the ergonomics of the interface in relation to musical expression and (ii) user-adaptive hand pose recognition as gestural control. The MRMI probe was experienced by 10 musician participants (mean age: 25.6 years [SD=3.0], 6 females, 4 males). We conducted a user evaluation comprising three stages. After an experimentation period, participants were asked to accompany a pre-recorded piece of music. In a post-task stage, participants took part in semi-structured interviews, which were subjected to thematic analysis. Prevalent themes included reducing the size of the interface, issues with the field of view of the device and physical strain from playing. Participants were largely in favour of hand poses as expressive control, although this depended on customisation and temporal dynamics; the use of interactive machine learning (IML) for user-adaptive hand pose recognition was well received by participants.},

In this research, we present co-design sessions with a Deaf dancer and a hearing musician to explore how they can influence each other’s expressive explorations. We also study vibrotactile wearable interface designs to better support the Deaf dancer’s perception of sound and music. We report our findings and observations on the co-design process over four workshops and one performance and public demonstration session. We detail the design and implementation of the wearable vibrotactile listening garment and participants’ selfreported experiences. This interface provides participants with more embodied listening opportunities and felt experiences of sound and music. All participants reported that the listening experience highlighted their first-person experience, focusing on their bodies, "regardless of an observer". These findings show how we can improve both such an internal experience of the listener and the collaboration potential between performers for increased inclusion. Overall, this paper addresses two different modalities of haptic feedback, the participation of Deaf users in wearable haptics design as well as music-movement performance practice, and artistic co-creation beyond technology development.},

In the context of music, a motive is a small, analysable musical fragment or phrase that is important in or characteristic of a composition. We outline our method for identifying and analysing motives in music made with new instruments, and display its use in a case study in which 10 musicians created performances with a new large-scale digital musical instrument that we designed. This research illustrates the value of a musicological approach to NIME research, suggesting the need for a broader conversation about a musicology of NIME performances, as distinct from its instruments.},

 abstract = {To the naked ear, the installation Being With The Waves appears silent, but a hidden composition of voices, instrumental tones, and maritime sounds is revealed through wearing modified headphones. The installation consists of an array of tweeters emitting a multi-channel ultrasonic composition that sounds physically in the space. Ultrasonic phenomena present at the listener’s ears are captured by microphones embedded on the outside of headphone earcups, shifted into audibility, and output to the headphones. The amplitude demodulation of ultrasonic material results in exaggerated Doppler effects and listeners hear the music bend and shift precisely with their movement. There are no movement sensors, mappings, or feedback loops, yet the installation is perceived as interactive due to the close entanglement of the listener with sound phenomena. The dynamic quality of interaction emerges solely through the listening faculties of the visitor, as an embodied sensory experience determined by their orientation to sounds, physical movement, and perceptual behaviour. This paper describes key influences on the installation, its ultrasonic technology, the design of modified headphones, and the compositional approach.},

As in the traditional artifact, the interaction of this new electronic yupana is based on the arrangement of seeds on a specially designed board with boxes, holes, and photoresistors. The shadow detected by the seeds’ positioning sends real-time motion data in MIDI messages to Pure Data in a drum machine patch. As a result, percussion samples of Andean instruments fill pulses in a four-quarter beat, generating patterns that can be transformed live into different rhythms. This interface complements the Electronic_Khipu_ (a previous NIME based on an Andean khipu) by producing the rhythmic component. This experience unites ancestral and contemporary technologies in experimental sound performance following the theoretical-practical research on the vindication of the memory in ancestral Andean technological interfaces made invisible by colonization, reusing them from a decolonial perspective in NIMEs.},
