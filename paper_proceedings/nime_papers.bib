The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time interface that can manipulate the parameters of a synthesis engine or effect algorithm in response to a performer's expressive gestures. One example is to have the rods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of a granular synthesizer, thereby "sonically sculpting" the microstructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIX provides an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.}

To describe the instrumentlets a design space is used consisting of the parameters degrees of freedom, range and precision. This paper is addressing the notion that traditional approaches to composition are challenged and changed in this situation, where the material is both audio and visual, and where the design and development of an instrument becomes involved in the process of performing and composing.}

As the intimacy between two people increases so does their ability to anticipate and predict the other's actions. We hypothesize that this intimacy between two people can be used as a basis for new controllers for musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and position sensors to track the rod's position. Each player holds opposite ends of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be built, is simply a string attached at both ends with two bridges. Tension is measured with strain gauges. Players manipulate the string tension at each end together to modulate sound. We are looking at different musical mappings appropriate for two players.}

The laser beams, which are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe. The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player's hands; this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player's hands from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical control. }

  abstract = {This paper describes the Genophone [2], a hyperinstrument developed for Sound-Performance-Design using the evolutionary paradigm of selective breeding as the driving process. Sound design, and control assignments (performance mappings), on most current systems rely heavily on an intimate knowledge of the Sound Synthesis Techniques (SSTs) employed by the sound generator (hardware or software based). This intimate knowledge can only be achieved by investing long periods of time playing around with sounds and experimenting with how parameters change the nature of the sounds produced. This experience is also needed when control mappings are defined for performance purposes, so external stimuli can effect changes in SST parameters. Often such experience can be gained after years of interaction with one particular SST. The system presented here attempts to aid the user in designing performance sounds and mappings without the necessity for deep knowledge of the SSTs involved. This is achieved by a selective breeding process on populations of individual sounds and their mapping. The initial populations are made up of individuals of existing hand-coded sounds and their mapping. Initial populations never have randomly derived individuals (this is not an issue as man's best friend was also not selectively bred from protozoa). The user previews the population then expresses how much individuals are liked by their relative repositioning on the screen (fitness). Some individuals are selected as parents to create a new population of offspring, through variable mutation and genetic recombination. These operators use the fitness as a bias for their function, and they were also successfully used in MutaSynth [1]. The offspring are then evaluated (as their parents were) and selected for breeding. This cycle continues until satisfactory sounds and their mapping are reached. Individuals can also be saved to disk for future "strain" development. The aim of the system is to encourage the creation of novel performance mappings and sounds with emphasis on exploration, rather than designs that satisfy specific a priori criteria.}

Each control can be used independently, but together they are mutually complementary. This reveals a fundamental difference from orthogonal systems.

When multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other's motifs. Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized "Nerve Center" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension between the system's stochastic routing scheme and the players' improvised real-time decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical experience. A musical composition entitled "Nerve" was written for the system by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover's Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted by Kent Nagano. The paper concludes with a short evaluative discussion of the concert and the weeklong workshops that led to it. }

It is not onlya metamorphosis of a traditional instrument, but a modern bridge of exploration into a rich musical heritage. It uses capacitive and piezo sensing technology to output MIDI and raw audio data.This new controller reads the key placement in two parallel planes by using radio capacitive sensing circuitry expanding greatly on the standard corrugated metal playing surface. The percussive output normally associated with the rubboard is captured through piezo contact sensors mounted directly on the keys (the playing implements). Additionally,mode functionality is controlled by discrete switching on the keys.This new instrument is meant to be easily played by both experienced players and those new to the rubboard. It lends itself to an expressive freedom by placing the control surface on the chest and allowing the hands to move uninhibited about it or by playing it in the usual way, preserving its musical heritage.}

In order to provide this insight into the subtleties of bow articulation, a sensing system has been integrated into a commercial carbon fiber bow to measure changes in position, acceleration, and the downward and lateral strains of the bow stick. The sensors were fashioned using an electromagnetic field sensing technique, commercial MEMS accelerometers, and foil strain gauges. The measurement techniques used in this work were found to be quite sensitive and yielded sensors that were easily controllable by a player using traditional right hand bowing technique.}

We report here our first experiences and our first steps towards a complete evaluation of system performances. Finally, we indicate directions how score following can go beyond the artistic applications known today.}

These serve to provide the user with gestural controllers whilst in addition giving tactile feedback to the user. Cymatic virtual instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in a manner that is highly intuitive. Users design and play these virtual instruments by interacting directly with their physical shape and structure in terms of the physical properties of basic objects such as strings, membranes and solids which can be interconnected to form complex structures. The virtual instrument can be excited at any point mass by the following: bowing, plucking, striking, sine/square/sawtooth/random waveform, or an external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any point masses to deliver the acoustic output. This paper describes the underlying structure and principles upon which Cymatic is based, and illustrates its acoustic output.}

  abstract = {We describe the design and implementation of an adaptive system to map control parameters to modal audio synthesis parameters in real-time. The modal parameters describe the linear response of a virtual vibrating solid, which is played as a musical instrument by a separate interface. The system uses a three layer feedforward backpropagation neural network which is trained by a discrete set of input-output examples. After training, the network extends the training set, which functions as the specification by example of the controller, to a continuous mapping allowing the real-time morphing of synthetic sound models.  We have implemented a prototype application using a controller which collects data from a hand-drawn digital picture. The virtual instrument consists of a bank of modal resonators whose frequencies, dampings, and gains are the parameters we control. We train the system by providing pictorial representations of physical objects such as a bell or a lamp, and associate high quality modal models obtained from measurements on real objects with these inputs. After training, the user can draw pictures interactively and “play” modal models which provide interesting (though unrealistic) interpolations of the models from the training set in real-time.}

The throughput model identifies symmetry betweenperformance gestures and musical gestures, and indicates a rolefor gestural primitives when a performer navigates regions ofstable oscillations in a musical instrument. The use of a highdimensional interface tool is proposed for instrument design, forfine-tuning the mapping between movement sensor data andsound synthesis control data.}

In a decentralized mechanical instrument, musical memory is an emergent global property of the system, undistinguishable from the execution process. Such a machine is botha score andan instrument. The paper starts by discussing the difference between sequential memory systems and systems exhibiting emergent decentralized musical behavior. Next, the use of particle system simulation for exploring virtual decentralized instruments is demonstrated, and the architecture for a simple decentralized instrument is outlined. The paper continues by describing the use of a genetic algorithm for evolving decentralized instruments that reproduce a given musical behavior.}

Tree Music, commissioned by the University of Virginia Art Museum, used a wireless camera with a wide-angle lens to capture motion and occlusion data from exhibit visitors. We show how GAIA was used to structure and navigate the compositional space, and how this program supports both graphical and text-based programming in the same application. GAIA provides a GUI which combines two open-source applications: RTcmix and Perl.}

This article explores the dynamic relation that builds between the player and the instrument, introducing concepts such as efficiency, apprenticeship and learning curve It aims at constructing a framework in which the possibilities and the diversity of music instruments as well as the possibilities and the expressive freedom of human music performers could start being evaluated. }

The turntable functions as a standalone step sequencer for MIDI events transmitted to a computer or another device and it is programmed in real-time using visual disks. The program instructions are represented on printed paper disks directly as characters of English alphabet that could be read by human as effectively as they are picked up by the machine's optical cartridge. The result is a tangible interface that allows the user to manipulate pre-arranged musical material by hand, by adding together instrumental tracks to form a dynamic mix. A functional implementation of this interface is discussed in view of historical background and other examples of electronic instruments for music creation and performance incorporating optical turntable as a central element.}

The second one uses chroma-profile, that is, a radarchart representation of the frequency of pitch notations in the-piece. By making keys of the same chroma hot in reverse proportion to the value of the chroma-profile, it is possible to-constrain the performer's improvisation and to bring the tonality space close to a certain piece.}

Various interfaces are presented which address these issues. We also discuss 3D “cube” controllers and visualizations, which go a long way in aiding usability. A range of implementations were realized, each with its own interface, automation, and output characteristics. We also explore a number of novel techniques. For example, a sound’s spectral components can be mapped in space based on its own components’ energy, or the energy of another signal’s components (a kind of spatial cross-synthesis). Finally, we address aesthetic concerns, such as perceptual and sonic coherency, which arise when sounds have been spectrally dissected and scattered across a multi-channel spatial field in 64, 128 or more spectral bands.}

Because of the fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. In this paper, we present a formalized framework for on-the-fly programming, based on the ChucK synthesis language, which supports a truly concurrent audio programming model with sample-synchronous timing, and a highly on-the-fly style of programming. We first provide a well-defined notion of on-thefly programming. We then address four fundamental issues that confront the on-the-fly programmer: timing, modularity, conciseness, and flexibility. Using the features and properties of ChucK, we show how it solves many of these issues. In this new model, we show that (1) concurrency provides natural modularity for on-the-fly programming, (2) the timing mechanism in ChucK guarantees on-the-fly precision and consistency, (3) the Chuck syntax improves conciseness, and (4) the overall system is a useful framework for exploring on-the-fly programming. Finally, we discuss the aesthetics of on-the-fly performance. }

Our instrument presents the performer with a large canvas where projected images can be grabbed and moved around with both hands simultaneously; the performer also has access to two video drums featuring haptic display to manipulate the shots and cut between streams.

This method offers a highly string-specific playability, as it is sensitive to the kinds of musical articulation produced by traditional playing techniques. Nuances of sound variation applied by the player will be present in the output signal even if those nuances are beyond traditionally measurable parameters like pitch, amplitude or brightness. The relatively minimal hardware requirements make the instrument accessible with little expenditure.}

The device senses everyday interactions and surrounding contexts, and maps this information in real time to the sound processing of urban sounds. We conducted a short-term study with various participants using our prototype in everyday settings. This paper describes the course of the study and preliminary results in terms of how the participants used and experienced the system. These results showed that the city was perceived as the main performer but that the user improvised different tactics and ad hoc interventions to actively influence and participate in how the music was created. }

My initial focus of investigation is the interaction between perceptions of auditory and visual beats. When the musical and graphical beats are completely synchronized with each other, as in a music video for promotional purposes, the audience feels that they are natural and comforting. My initial experiment has proved that the actual tempos of music and images are a little different. If a slight timelag exists between the musical and pictorial beats, the audience tries to keep them in synchronization by unconsciously changing the interpretation of the time-based beat points. As the lag increases over time, the audience seems to perceive that the beat synchronization has changed from being more downbeat to more upbeat, and continues enjoying it. I have developed an experiment system that can generateand control out-of-phase visual and auditory beats in real time, and have tested many subjects with it. This paper describes the measurement of time lags generated in the experiment system, as part of my psychological experiment.}

Since improvisation is the musical performance style that involves creating melodies while playing, it is not easy even for the people who can play musical instruments. However, previous studies have not dealt with improvisation support for the people who can play musical instruments but cannot improvise. In this study, to support such players' improvisation, we propose a novel improvisation supporting system called ism, which corrects musically unnatural melodies automatically. The main issue in realizing this system is how to detect notes to be corrected (i.e., musically unnatural or inappropriate). We propose a method for detecting notes to be corrected based on the N-gram model. This method first calculates N-gram probabilities of played notes, and then judges notes with low N-gram probabilities to be corrected. Experimental results show that the N-gram-based melody correction and the proposed system are useful for supporting improvisation.}

Rhythm action games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video game and toy markets in record numbers. Therefore, it is worth considering the potential benefits to developers of musical interfaces, electronic devices and alternate controllers in light of these new and emerging opportunities, particularly in the realm of video gaming, toy development, arcades, and other interactive entertainment experiences. }

These sensors provide continuous and discrete user-controlled parametric data to be mapped at will to signal processing parameters, virtual instrument control parameters, sound playback, and various other functions. In its current manifestation, control data is mapped to change the processing of the instrument's natural sound in Pd (Pure Data) [3]. SCUBA preserves the unity of the solo instrument interface by acoustically mixing direct and processed sound in the instrument's bell via mounted satellite speakers, which are driven by a subwoofer below the performer's chair. The end result augments the existing interface while preserving its original unity and functionality. }

The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer's finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.}

Recently, several devices have been developed using alternatives to MIDI, including Ethernet-based and USB-based sensor interfaces. We have designed and produced a system that uses S/PDIF as the transport mechanism for a sensor interface. This provides robust performance, together with extremely low latency and high resolution. In our system, data from all sensors is multiplexed onto the digital audio line and demultiplexed in software on the computer using standard techniques. We have written demultiplexer objects and plugins for Max/MSP and Jade, as well as a MIDI Conversion program for interapplicaton uses, while others are in the works for PD, SuperCollider, and AudioUnits.}

What does one do with a complex new digital instrument? In this paper I address this question drawing on my expe- rience in learning several very different types of sophisticated instruments: the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speech interface, the Digital Marionette controller for virtual 3D puppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary user of the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hours with Digital Marionette and Glove-Talk II, and thousands of hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue to work as a professional musician). I will identify some of the under- lying principles and approaches that I have observed during my learning and playing experience common to these instru- ments. While typical accounts of users learning new inter- faces generally focus on reporting beginner’s experiences, for various practical reasons, this is fundamentally different by focusing on the expert’s learning experience.}

WISEAR is both lightweight and wireless. Unlike several commercial alternatives, it is also a completely open source project.  PAIR (Partnering Analysis in Real Time) exploits the power of WISEAR and revisits the potential of hardware-based systems for real-time measurement of bodily movement. Our goal was to create a robust yet adaptable system that could attend to both general and precise aspects of performer interaction. Though certain commonalities with existing hardware systems exist, our PAIR system takes a fundamentally different approach by focusing specifically on the interaction of two or more dancers.}

Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.}

Assuming that a singing voice is a kind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singing voice are important for personification. We adopt a singing voice morphing algorithm that effectively smoothes out the strength of expressions delivered with a singing voice. The system’s hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bend sensors and two pressure sensors. It sensitively captures the user’s motion as a personified puppet’s gesture. To synthesize the different expressional strengths of a singing voice, the “normal” (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, “dark,” “whisper” and “wet,” are used as the target. This configuration provides musically expressed controls that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, we evaluate whether 1) the morphing algorithm interpolates expressional strength in a perceptual sense, 2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and 3) the gestural mapping of the current system works as planned.}

Human Interface Devices (HIDs) such as joysticks,tablets, and gamepads are cheap and can be good musicalcontrollers. Some even provide haptic feedback. The [hid]toolkit provides a unified, consistent framework for gettinggestural data from these devices, controlling the feedback,and mapping this data to the desired output. The [hid]toolkit is built in Pd, which provides an ideal platform forthis work, combining the ability to synthesize and controlaudio and video.

The results show that hitting the drum alternately from both sides with motion going through the drum plate was less accurate than the traditional one sided hitting. A physical stick was more accurate than a virtual computer graphic stick. Visual feedback of the drum slightly increased accuracy compared to receiving only auditory feedback. Most subjects evaluated the physical stick to offer a better feeling and to be more pleasant than the virtual stick. }

The paper discusses the process that replicates a Pure Data patch so that it will operate within the hardware and software constraints of the Java 2 Micro Edition. It also describes development of objects that will enable mobile phone performances to be simulated accurately in PD and to audition microtonal tuning implemented using MIDI in the j2me environment. These tools eliminate the need for composers to compose for mobile phones by writing java code. In a single desktop application, they offer the composer the flexibility to write music for multiple phones. }

With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time.}

In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly. }

One physical controller corresponds to one GUI controller on a PC’s display device, and a user can freely change the connection on the fly (i.e. associate the physical controller to another GUI controller). Since the user interface on the PC side is running on the Max/MSP environment that has high flexibility, a user can freely reconfigure the layout of GUI controllers. A single ‘Spinner’ control device consists of a rotary encoder with a push button to count rotations and a photo IC to detect specific patterns from the GUI objects to identify. Since ‘Spinner’ features a simple identification method, it is capable of being used with normal display devices like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and so on. A user can access multiple ‘Spinner’ devices simultaneously. By using this system, a user can build a reconfigurable user interface.}

The driver'sdecisions affect in real-time the rendering of the piece. Thepedals and wheel provide a tactile interface for controlling thecar dynamics and musical expression, while the displayportrays a first person view of the road and dashboard from thedriver's seat. This game-like interface allows non-experts tocreate expressive renderings of existing music without havingto master an instrument, and allows expert musicians toexperiment with expressive choice without having to firstmaster the notes of the piece. The prototype system has beentested and refined in numerous demonstrations. This paperpresents the concepts underlying the ESP system and thearchitectural design and implementation of a prototype.}

One limitation of this kind of test is the inherent difficulty of measuring an emotional reaction in a laboratory setting. This paper describes the design, functions and possible uses of the software tool REMUPP (Relations between musical parameters and perceived properties), designed for investigating various aspects of musical experience. REMUPP allows for non-verbal examination of selected musical parameters (such as tonality, tempo, timbre, articulation, volume, register etc.) in a musical context. The musical control is put into the hands of the subject, introducing an element of creativity and enhancing the sense of immersion. Information acquired with REMUPP can be output as numerical data for statistical analysis, but the tool is also suited for the use with more qualitatively oriented methods.}

  abstract = {This paper describes two new live performance scenarios for performing music using bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. Interaction between mobile phones via wireless link is a key feature of the performance interface for each scenario. Both scenarios are discussed in the context of two publicly performed works for an ensemble of players in which mobile phone handsets are used both as sound sources and as hand-held controllers. In both works mobile phones are mounted in a specially devised pouch attached to a cord and physically swung to produce audio chorusing. During performance some players swing phones while others operate phones as hand-held controllers. Wireless connectivity enables interaction between flying and hand-held phones. Each work features different bluetooth implementations. In one a dedicated mobile phone acts as a server that interconnects multiple clients, while in the other point to point communication takes place between clients on an ad hoc basis. The paper summarises bluetooth tools designed for live performance realisation and concludes with a comparative evaluation of both scenarios for future implementation of performance by large ensembles of nonexpert players performing microtonal music using ubiquitous technology. }

Several examples of mapping MIDI parameters to game events are presented. As mobile phones' MIDI players do not usually have a dedicated callback API, a real-time MIDI analysis software for Symbian OS was implemented. Future developments including real-time group performance as a way to control game content are also considered. }

Ideally, it should be possible to store all sorts of data from various commercial and custom made controllers, motion capture and computer vision systems, as well as results from different types of gesture analysis, in a coherent and consistent way. This would make it possible to use the information with different software, platforms and devices, and also allow for sharing data between research institutions. We present some of the data types that should be included, and discuss issues which need to be resolved.}

The 'GXtar' is an instrument which takes as a starting point a guitar but his role is to bring different and new musical possibilities while preserving the spirit and techniques of guitar. Therefore, it was conceived and carried out starting from the body of an electric guitar. The fingerboard of this guitar was equipped with two lines of sensors: linear position sensors, and tactile pressure sensors. These two lines of sensors are used as two virtual strings. Their two ends are the bridge and the nut of the guitar. The design of the instrument is made in a way that the position of a finger, on one of these virtual strings, corresponds to the note, which would have been played on a real and vibrating string. On the soundboard of the guitar, a controller, with 3 degrees of freedom, allows to drive other synthesis parameters. We then describe how this interface is integrated in a musical audio system and serves as a musical instrument. }

The video data are used to detect the moments of bow direction changes. This information is used for piece-wise integration of the accelerometer signal, resulting in a drift-free reconstructed velocity signal with a high temporal resolution. The method was evaluated using a 3D motion capturing system, providing a reliable reference of the actual bow velocity. The method showed good results when the accelerometer and video stream are synchronized. Additional latency and jitter of the camera stream can importantly decrease the performance of the method, depending on the bow stroke type. }

At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto match a user's gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo, gesture size, and the gesture'sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches, conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90%. conga is deployed as the gesture recognition systemfor Maestro!, an interactive conducting exhibit that opened in theBetty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee, USA in March2006.}

We collect video data from a lot of performances of the sameshow from which it should be possible to visualize all the emotions and intents or more precisely "intent graphs". To perform this, the collected data defining low-level descriptors are aggregated and converted into high-level characterizations. Then, depending on the retrieved data and on their distributionon the axis, we partition the universes into classes. The last stepis the building of the fuzzy rules that are obtained from the classes and that permit to give conclusions to label the detected emotions.}

In addition to musical parameters such as pitch and loudness, our system is able to analyze timbral characteristics of the saxophone tone in real-time, and use timbral information to guide the generation of response material. We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments in a free improvisation context. }

It is based on a complex physical model of the vibrating plate --- the source of sound in the majority of percussion instruments. A Xilinx Virtex II pro FPGA core handles the sound synthesis computations with an 8 billion operations per second performance and has been designed in such a way to allow a high level of control and flexibility. Strategies are also presented to that allow the parametric space of the model to be mapped to the playing gestures of the percussionist.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe the musical development of a new system for performing electronic music where a video-based eye movement recording system, known as Oculog, is used to control sound. Its development is discussed against a background that includes a brief history of biologically based interfaces for performing music, together with a survey of various recording systems currently in use for monitoring eye movement in clinical applications. Oculog is discussed with specific reference to its implementation as a performance interface for electronic music. A new work features algorithms driven by eye movement response and allows the user to interact with audio synthesis and introduces new possibilities for microtonal performance. Discussion reflects an earlier technological paradigm and concludes by reviewing possibilities for future development.}

This research presents a new approach to the mapping problem resulting from a primary design research phase and a prototype testing and evaluation phase. In order to establish an underlying design approach for the ThummerTM mapping strategies, a number of interviews were carried out with high-level acoustic instrumental performers, the majority of whom play with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Sydney, Australia. Mapping strategies were developed from analysis of these interviews and then evaluated in trial usability testing.}

  abstract = {Musical performers need to show off their virtuosity for selfexpression and communicate with other people. Therefore, they are prepared to perform at any time and anywhere. However, a musical keyboard of 88 keys is too large and too heavy to carry around. When a portable keyboard that is suitable for carrying around is played over a wide range, the notes being played frequently cause the diapason of the keyboard to protrude. It is common to use Key Transpose in conventional portable keyboards, which shifts the diapason of the keyboard. However, this function creates several problems such as the feeling of discomfort from the misalignment between the keying positions and their output sounds. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct Mobile Clavier, which enables the diapason to be changed smoothly. Mobile Clavier resolves the problems with Key Transpose by having black keys inserted between any two side-by-side white keys. This paper also discusses how effective Mobile Clavier was in an experiment conducted using professional pianists. We can play music at any time and anywhere with Mobile Clavier.}

The approach used in the survey was phenomenological, i.e. we were concerned with the experience of playing, composing for and designing digital or acoustic instruments. At the time of analysis, we had 209 replies from musicians, composers, engineers, designers, artists and others interested in this topic. The survey was mainly aimed at instrumentalists and people who create their own instruments or compositions in flexible audio programming environments such as SuperCollider, Pure Data, ChucK, Max/MSP, CSound, etc. }

As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents. An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis of artistic processes and technologies. }

  abstract = {This paper presents two main ideas: (1) Various newly invented liquid-based or underwater musical instruments are proposed that function like woodwind instruments but use water instead of air. These “woodwater” instruments expand the space of known instruments to include all three states of matter: solid (strings, percussion); liquid (the proposed instruments); and gas (brass and woodwinds). Instruments that use the fourth state of matter (plasma) are also proposed. (2) Although the current trend in musical interfaces has been to expand versatililty and generality by separating the interface from the sound-producing medium, this paper identifies an opposite trend in musical interface design inspired by instruments such as the harp, the acoustic or electric guitar, the tin whistle, and the Neanderthal flute, that have a directness of user-interface, where the fingers of the musician are in direct physical contact with the sound-producing medium. The newly invented instruments are thus designed to have this sensually tempting intimacy not be lost behind layers of abstraction, while also allowing for the high degree of virtuosity. Examples presented include the poseidophone, an instrument made from an array of ripple tanks, each tuned for a particular note, and the hydraulophone, an instrument in which sound is produced by pressurized hydraulic fluid that is in direct physical contact with the fingers of the player. Instruments based on these primordial media tend to fall outside existing classifications and taxonomies of known musical instruments which only consider instruments that make sound with solid or gaseous states of matter. To better understand and contextualize some of the new primordial user interfaces, a broader concept of musical instrument classification is proposed that considers the states of matter of both the user-interface and the sound production medium.}

  abstract = {This paper describes work on a newly created large-scale interactive theater performance entitled Schwelle (Thresholds). The authors discuss an innovative approach towards the conception, development and implementation of dynamic and responsive audio scenography: a constantly evolving, multi-layered sound design generated by continuous input from a series of distributed wireless sensors deployed both on the body of a performer and placed within the physical stage environment. The paper is divided into conceptual and technological parts. We first describe the project’s dramaturgical and conceptual context in order to situate the artistic framework that has guided the technological system design. Specifically, this framework discusses the team’s approach in combining techniques from situated computing, theatrical sound design practice and dynamical systems in order to create a new kind of adaptive audio scenographic environment augmented by wireless, distributed sensing for use in live theatrical performance. The goal of this adaptive sound design is to move beyond both existing playback models used in theatre sound as well as the purely humancentered, controller-instrument approach used in much current interactive performance practice.}

We present ‘ParticleTecture’, a soundspace installation system that extends spatial perception of ordinary architectural space through gestural interaction with sound in space. ParticleTecture employs a particle metaphor to produce granular synthesis soundspaces in response to video-tracking of human movement. It incorporates an adaptive mechanism that utilizes a measure of engagement to inform ongoing audio patterns in response to human activity. By identifying engaging features in its response, the system is able to predict, pre-empt and shape its evolving responses in accordance with the most engaging, compelling, interesting attributes of the active environment. An implementation of ParticleTecture for gallery installation is presented and discussed as one form of architectural space.}

Current research hasextended the abilities of the device to take real-time audio andvideo data from USB cameras and audio devices, as well asrunning synthesis engines on board the device itself. Given itsgeneric network ability (eg., being an 802.11a/b/g device) there istheoretically no limit to the number of WISEAR boxes that canbe used simultaneously in a performance, facilitating multiperformer compositions.

Such an embedding is a representation or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion. }

Mimi's visual interface allows for a peculiar blendof raw reflex typically associated with improvisation, andpreparation and timing more closely affiliated with scorebased reading. Mimi is not only an effective improvisationpartner, it has also proven itself to be an invaluable platformthrough which to interrogate the mental models necessaryfor successful improvisation.}

Trajectories provided by these signals are used as Target Sets of an evolutionary algorithm. A Fitness procedure optimizes locally the distance between the Target Set and the SSG pairs.

This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum, the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs. Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions well as an educational tool.}

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss our progress on the HID toolkit, a collection of software modules for the Pure Data and Max/MSP programming environments that provide unified, user-friendly and cross-platform access to human interface devices (HIDs) such as joysticks, digitizer tablets, and stomp-pads. These HIDs are ubiquitous, inexpensive and capable of sensing a wide range of human gesture, making them appealing interfaces for interactive media control. However, it is difficult to utilize many of these devices for custom-made applications, particularly for novices. The modules we discuss in this paper are [hidio], which handles incoming and outgoing data between a patch and a HID, and [input noticer], which monitors HID plug/unplug events. The goal in creating these modules is to preserve maximal flexibility in accessing the input and output capabilities of HIDs, in a manner that is ap- proachable for both sophisticated and beginning designers. This paper documents our design notes and implementa- tion considerations, current progress, and ideas for future extensions to the HID toolkit.}

The focus is on sound processing techniques which contain a high number of control parameters,and which exhibit subtle and interesting micro-variationsand textural qualities when controlled properly. The examples all use a simple low-dimensional controller --- a standard graphics tablet --- and the task of initimate and subtle textural manipulations is left to the design of proper mappings,created using a custom toolbox of mapping functions. Thiswork further acts to contextualize past theoretical results bythe given musical presentations, and arrives at some conclusions about the interplay between musical intention, controlstrategies and the process of their design.}

A physical brush on a canvas acts as the instrument. The characteristics of its stroke are intuitively mapped to a conductor program, defining expressive parameters of the tone in real-time. Two different interaction modes highlight the importance of bodily expression in making music as well as the value of a metaphorical visual representation.}

The sensitivity of the sensors can be modified for each unique individual so that even the smallest movement can control a sound. The flexibility of the system is such that either four people can play simultaneously and/or one or more players can use up to four sensors. The original goal of this program was to empower students with disabilities to create music and encourage them to perform with other musicians, however this same goal has expanded to include other populations.}

To overcome thisconstraint in the context of musical interaction, we presenta system to manage large-scale collaborative mobile audioenvironments, driven by user movement. Multiple participants navigate through physical space while sharing overlaid virtual elements. Each user is equipped with a mobilecomputing device, GPS receiver, orientation sensor, microphone, headphones, or various combinations of these technologies. We investigate methods of location tracking, wireless audio streaming, and state management between mobiledevices and centralized servers. The result is a system thatallows mobile users, with subjective 3-D audio rendering,to share virtual scenes. The audio elements of these scenescan be organized into large-scale spatial audio interfaces,thus allowing for immersive mobile performance, locativeaudio installations, and many new forms of collaborativesonic activity.}

  abstract = {It started with an idea to create an empty space in which you activated music and light as you moved around. In responding to the music and lighting you would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children's spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children's movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation. }

The system described, Kinetic Engine, is an environment in which individual software agents, emulate drummers improvising within a percussion ensemble. Player agents assume roles and personalities within the ensemble, and communicate with one another to create complex rhythmic interactions. In this project, the ensemble is comprised of a 12-armed musical robot, MahaDeviBot, in which each limb has its own software agent controlling what it performs. }

Composing music for and in a landscape instead of for a closed architectural space offers new perspectives but also raises questions about interaction and composition of electronic music. The work we present here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user's willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape and for creating audience interaction are explored. }

Second, all parameters are "live" as usual, but turning one knob or setting a switch will also change the settings of other, statistically related controls. Both approaches canbe used with the standard interface of the synthesizer. On top of that, this paper introduces alternative or additional interfaces based on data visualization.}

By connecting these three platforms via the OSC protocol, we enable the control in real time of analog physical media (a device that draws figures on sand), sound synthesis and image synthesis. We worked on the development of algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media. }

After discussing the functions requiredfor user-oriented interface for performance rendering systems, this paper proposes a directable case-based performance rendering system, called Itopul.

These parameters controla two-axis digital waveguide virtual string, which modelsvibrations in the horizontal and vertical transverse axes aswell as the coupling between them. Finally, we consider theadvantages of using a multi-axis pickup for measuring theexcitation signal.}

Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones. The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors: 1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11], [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles of music. }

The primary goal of this study was to determine how players' actions changed when moving from an acoustic instrument like the tom drum, to a gestural controller like the Buchla Lightning, which bears little resemblance to an acoustic percussion instrument. Motion capture data was analyzed by comparing a subject's hand height variability and timing accuracy across the four instruments as they performed simple musical tasks. Results suggest that certain gestures such as hand height amplitude can be adapted to these gestural controllers with little change and that in general subjects' timing variability is significantly affected when playing on the Lightning and Radio Baton when compared to the more familiar tom drum and VDrum. Possible explanations and other observations are also presented. }

This paper presents an evaluation of several force renderings for target acquisition in space when used to support a music related task. The study presented here addresses only one musical aspect: the need to repeat elements accurately in time and in content. Several force scenarios will be rendered over a simple 3D target acquisition task and users' performance will be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The results show how the users' subjective preference for a particular kind of force support does not always correlate to a quantitative measurement of performance enhancement. We describe a way in which a control mapping for a musical interface could be achieved without contradicting the users' preferences as obtained from the study. }

Gestures are transformed into electronic signals by sensors. Powered Suit is another suit that a dancer wears, but gestures are generated by motors. This is a sort of wearable robot. Second Life is software that is developed by Linden Lab. It allows creating a virtual world and a virtual human (avatar) in Internet.

A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping, clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra is a fusion system of the design of a performer and the emergence of cellular automata as a complex system. }

This performance system has been implemented using Max 5 [1] within the genre of popular contemporary electronic music, incorporating techno, IDM, and related forms. The aim of this project is not musical style synthesis, but to construct an environment in which a range of creative and musical goals may be achieved. A key aspect is control over generative processes, as well as consistent yet varied output. An approach is described which frees the user from determining note-level output while allowing control to be maintained over larger structural details, focusing specifically on the melodic aspect of this system.

As a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda Saxophonist Robot WAS-1 have been designed to reproduce the human player performance. As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with human players. In general the communication of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior. Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states of the musicians. So the development of an artificial entity that participates in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore, we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview of our research approaches towards enabling the interaction between musical performance robots as well as with musicians. }

The Tactus is an expandable and inexpensive musical interface for the creation of loop-based music inspired by the Bubblegum Sequencer [2]. An optical camera, coupled with a computer running Max/MSP/Jitter can turn almost any matrix-like object into a step sequencer. The empty cells in the gridded object are filled with a fitting, colored object; the placement of which is analogous to adding an instrument or switching on a box in a step sequencer grid. The color and column position of every element in the matrix are used as parameters for a synthesizer while the row position of that element corresponds to the moment within the loop that entry is sounded. The two dimensional array can be positioned anywhere within the camera's visibility. Both the translation and rotation of the physical matrix are assigned to global parameters that affect the music while preserving the color and order of the cells. A rotation of 180 degrees, for example, will not reverse the sequence, but instead change an assigned global parameter.}

The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on the instrument's body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely used in the acoustic instrumentalpraxis. They yield a strong potential for providing anextended soundscape via instrument augmentation, directlycontrolled by the musician through haptic manipulation ofthe instrument itself.

The motion of the subjects breathing is trackedand interpreted as a real-time variable tempo adjustment toa stored musical file. The subject can then adjust his/herbreathing to synchronize with a separate accompanimentline. When the breathing is regular and is at the desiredtempo, the audible result sounds synchronous and harmonious. The accompaniment's tempo progresses and gradually decrease which causes the breathing to synchronize andslow down, thus increasing relaxation.}

Gesturetrajectories are displayed in real time and can be comparedto the corresponding diagram shown in a textbook. In addition, since a conductor normally does not look at a screenwhile conducting, tones are played to represent a certainbeat in a conducting gesture. Further, the system can be controlled entirely with the baton, removing the need to switchfrom baton to mouse. The interface is intended to be usedfor pedagogy purposes.}

It also loads a plugin code module that acts as a composition. A plugin maps pieces and relationships on the board, such as support or attack relationships, to a timed sequence of notes and accents. The server transmits notes in a sequence to an audio renderer process via network datagrams. Two players can perform a composition by playing chess, and a player can improvise by adjusting a plugin's music mapping parameters via a graphical user interface. A composer can create a new composition by writing a new plugin that uses a distinct algorithm for mapping game rules and states to music. A composer can also write a new note-to-sound mapping program in the audio renderer language. This software is available at http://faculty.kutztown.edu/parson/music/ParsonMusic.html. }

To improve the assistance, we augment the interface with programmed detents so that the musician can feelthe locations of equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, themusician can still perform arbitrary pitch inflections such asglissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various formsof haptic detents, including fixed detent levels and forcesensitive detent levels. Preliminary results from a subjecttest confirm improved accuracy in pitch selection broughtabout by detents.}

Like the piano keyboard, the velocity of a player's impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon in Canberra. }

In addition to the standard paradigm of tracks, regions and tape recording analogy, FrameWorks displays hierarchical and transformational information in a single, fully navigable workspace. The implementation combines Java with Max/MSP to create a cross-platform, user-extensible package and will be used to assess the viability of such a tool and to develop the ideas further. }

Positions can be read from the haptic device, and forces can be written to the device using messages in Pd. Various additional objects have been created to facilitate rapid prototyping of useful haptic musical instruments in Pd. HSP operates under Linux, OS X, and Windows and supports the mass-produced Falcon haptic device from NovInt, which can currently be obtained for as little as US\$150. All of the above make HSP an especially excellent choice for pedagogical environments where multiple workstations are required and example programs should be complete yet simple.}

The open-source nature of the device has allowed for a small group of Monome users to modify the hardware, firmware, and software associated with the interface. These user driven modifications have allowed the re-imagining of the interface for new and novel purposes, beyond even that of the device's original intentions. With development being driven by a community of users, a device can become several related but unique generations of musical controllers, each one focused on a specific set of needs. }

At the same time, various types of electronic musical instruments have been developed. Since the main purpose of conventional electronic instruments is to duplicate the shape of acoustic instruments with no change in their hardware configuration, the diapason and the performance style of each instrument is inflexible. Therefore, the goal of our study is to construct the UnitInstrument that consists of various types of musical units. A unit is constructed by simulating functional elements of conventional musical instruments, such as output timing of sound and pitch decision. Each unit has connectors for connecting other units to create various types of musical instruments. Additionally, we propose a language for easily and flexibly describing the settings of units. We evaluated the effectiveness of our proposed system by using it in actual performances.}

  abstract = {With the author’s own experiences in mind, this paper argues that, when used to amplify musical instruments or to play back other sonic material to an audience, loudspeakers and the technology that drives them, can be considered as a musical instrument. Particularly in situations with acoustic instruments this perspective can provide insight into the often cumbersome relation between the –technology orientated– sound engineer and the –music orientated– performer. Playing a musical instrument (whether acoustic, electric or electronic) involves navigating often complicated but very precise interfaces. The interface for sound amplification technology in a certain environment is not limited to the control surface of a mixing desk but includes the interaction with other stakeholder, i.e. the performers and the choice of loudspeakers and microphones and their positions. As such this interface can be as accurate and intimate but also as complicated as the interfaces of 'normal' musical instruments. By zooming in on differences between acoustic and electronic sources a step is taken towards inclusion in this discussion of the perception of amplified music and the possible influence of that amplification on performance practise.}

Generation of audible sound by self-demodulation of an ultrasound signal during its propagation through air; 2. The condensation of the ultrasound energy in one spatial point generating a precise tactile reproduction of the audible sound; and 3. The feed-forward method enabling a real-time intervention of the musician, by shaping the tactile (ultra)sound directly with his hands.}

The shape of each plate must be determined in the design process so that the metallophone willproduce the proper tone when struck with a mallet. Unfortunately, the relationship between plate shape and tone iscomplex, which makes it difficult to design plates with arbitrary shapes. Our system addresses this problem by runninga concurrent numerical eigenanalysis during interactive geometry editing. It continuously presents a predicted tone tothe user with both visual and audio feedback, thus makingit possible to design a plate with any desired shape and tone.We developed this system to demonstrate the effectivenessof integrating real-time finite element method analysis intogeometric editing to facilitate the design of custom-mademusical instruments. An informal study demonstrated theability of technically unsophisticated user to apply the system to complex metallophone design.}

We collected many ideas from currently available music programming languages and librariesto design and create the new capabilities in Minim. Thebasic mechanisms include chained unit generators, instruments, and notes. In general, one "patches" unit generators(for example, oscillators, delays, and envelopes) together inorder to create synthesis algorithms. These algorithms canthen either create continuous sound, or be used in instruments to play notes with specific start time and duration.We have written a base set of unit generators to enablea wide variety of synthesis options, and the capabilities ofthe unit generators, instruments, and Processing allow fora wide range of composition techniques.}

Our preliminary study investigates the non-verbal strategies employed for negotiation of our capacity for action with other bodies and the surrounding space through body-to-body and body-to-space couplings enabled by sensory supplementation devices. We employed a lowfi rapid prototyping approach to build this device, enabling distal perception by sonic and haptic feedback. Further, we conducted a workshop in which participants equipped with this device engaged in game-like activities. }

The interface of the Device Server allows users to see how devices are assigned to application functionalities, alter these assignments and save them into configuration files for later use. Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts to homogenize the appearance of different control signals to applications so that users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities and easily experiment with different control configurations.}

  abstract = {Writing text messages (e.g. email, SMS, instant messaging) is a popular form of synchronous and asynchronous communication. However, when it comes to notifying users about new messages, current audio-based approaches, such as notification tones, are very limited in conveying information. In this paper we show how entire text messages can be encoded into a meaningful and euphonic melody in such a way that users can guess a message’s intention without actually seeing the content. First, as a proof of concept, we report on the findings of an initial on-line survey among 37 musicians and 32 non-musicians evaluating the feasibility and validity of our approach. We show that our representation is understandable and that there are no significant differences between musicians and non-musicians. Second, we evaluated the approach in a real world scenario based on a Skype plug-in. In a field study with 14 participants we showed that sonified text messages strongly impact on the users’ message checking behavior by significantly reducing the time between receiving and reading an incoming message.}

The interactive repertoires are therefore partially pre-determined through enculturated behaviors that are associated with particular objects, but more importantly, inextricably linked to the thematic and meaningful assemblage of the work itself. Our new work epi-thet gathers data from individual interactions with common microscopes placed on platforms within a large space. This data is correlated with public domain genetic datasets obtained from micro-array analysis. A sonification algorithm generates unique compositions associated with the spectator "as measured" through their individual specification in performing an iconic measurement action. The apparatus is a receptacle for unique compositions in sound, and invites a participatory choreography of stillness that is available for reception as a live musical performance. }

Descriptive properties of the complex behaviour of these equationsare then determined as a function of difference tones derived from a Just Intonation scale and the amplitude ofthe audio signal. By using only the real-time audio signalfrom live performer/s as an input the causal relationshipbetween acoustic performance gestures and computer output, including any visual or performer-instruction output,is deterministic even if the chaotic behaviours are not.}

Thus we believe that it is suitable for not only artists such as algorithmic composers or audiovisual performers, but also anyone who wants to play music and imagery in a different way. }

The sounds generated by the traditional digital musical instruments are dependent on the physical shape of the musical instruments. The freedom of the musical performance is restricted by its structure. Therefore, the sounds cannot be generated with the body expression like the dance. We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance. }

To do this requires a deep consideration of the space of musical actions, so as to explicate what opposition should constitute, and machine listening technology (most prominently represented by new online beat and stream tracking algorithms) which gives an accurate measurement of player position so as to consistently avoid it. An initial pilot evaluation was undertaken, feeding back critical data to the developing design.}

This paper presents an interface that is designed to liberate the composer from thinking of spatialised sound as points in space. Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time. }

Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure.

Creators of new computerbased instruments face similar design challenges as those in HCI. In the course of creating a new piece for Mobile Phone Orchestra we propose the metaphor of a sound as a ball and explore the interactions and sound mappings it suggests. These lead to the design of a gesture-controlled instrument that allows players to "bounce" sounds, "throw" them to other players, and compete in a game to "knock out" others' sounds. We composed the piece SoundBounce based on these interactions, and note that audiences seem to find performances of the piece accessible and engaging, perhaps due to the visibility of the metaphor. }

We find that accelerometers are difficult to control for this purpose. Android's pressure sensing shows some promise, especially when combined with augmented playing technique. Force sensing resistors can offer good dynamic resolution but this technology is not currently offered in commodity devices and proper coupling of the sensor with the applied impact is difficult. }

While networked technologies eliminate distance in physical space, for the remote improviser, this creates a liminality of experience through which their performance is mediated. As a first step in understanding the conditions arising from collaboration in networked audio platforms, this paper will examine selected case studies of improvisation in a variety of networked interfaces. The author will examine how platform characteristics and network conditions influence the process of collective improvisation and the methodologies musicians are employing to negotiate their networked experiences.}

Glitch DeLighter uses ordinary lighters as physical controllers that can be played by creating a flame and moving it in the air. Droned sounds are played by sustaining the flame and beats by generating sparks and fast flames. The pitch of every sound can be changed moving the flame vertically in the air. This is achieved by using a custom computer vision system as an interface which maps the real-time the data extracted from the flame and transmits those parameters to the sound generator. As a result, the flame visual dynamics are deeply connected to the aural perception of the sound - ‘the sound seems to be burning’. This process establishes a metaphor dramaturgically engaging for an audience. This paper contextualizes the glitch music aesthetics, prior research, the design and development of the instrument and reports on Burning The Sound– the first music composition created and performed with the instrument (by the author).}

Wealso present an augmented piano keyboard which reportsthe continuous position of every key. Time and spatial resolution are sufficient to capture detailed data about keypress, release, pretouch, aftertouch, and other extended gestures. The system, which is designed with cost and setupconstraints in mind, seeks to give pianists continuous control over the musical sound of their instrument.

The envelopes are filled with harmonic andnoisy content and given to an additive synthesizer in order to produce violin sounds. The sensing system is based on two motion trackers with 6 degrees of freedom. One tracker is attached to the bow and the other to the tube. Bowing controls are computed after a calibration process where the position of virtual strings and the hair-ribbon of the bowis obtained. A real time implementation was developed asa MAX/MSP patch with external objects for each of the modules.}

  abstract = {Input devices for controlling music software can benefit fromexploiting the use of perceptual-motor skill in interaction.The project described here is a new musical controller, designed with the aim of enabling intuitive and nuanced interaction through direct physical manipulation of malleablematerial.The controller is made from conductive foam. This foamchanges electrical resistance when deformed; the controllerworks by measuring resistance at multiple points in a single piece of foam in order to track its shape. These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences. Thecontroller achieves its aim of enabling intuitive interaction,but in terms of nuanced interaction, accuracy and repeatability were issues for some participants. It's not clear fromthe short evaluation study whether these issues would improve with practice, a longitudinal study that gives musicians time to practice and find the creative limitations ofthe controller would help to evaluate this fully.The evaluation highlighted interesting issues concerningthe high level nature of malleable control and different approaches to sonic exploration.}

According to the common need ofadaptable visual interface to manipulate music, in this paper we present a custom tridimensional controller, based onOpen Sound Control protocol and completely designed towork inside Virtual Reality: simple geometrical shapes canbe created to directly control loop triggering and parametermodification, just using free hand interaction.}

The increased presence of multichannel devices, along with the high sampling frequency, makesthe sound card desirable as a generic interface for acquisition of analog signals in prototyping of sensor-based musicinterfaces. However, due to the need for coupling capacitorsat a sound card's inputs and outputs, the use as a genericsignal interface of a sound card is limited to signals not carrying information in a constant DC component. Through arevisit of a card design for the (now defunct) ISA bus, thispaper proposes use of analog gates for bypassing the DCfiltering input sections, controllable from software --- therebyallowing for arbitrary choice by the user, if a soundcardinput channel is to be used as a generic analog-to-digitalsensor interface. Issues regarding use of obsolete technology and educational aspects are discussed as well.}

Significant features of this Fuzzy Logic framework are its inclusiveness through the consideration of all the many and varied musical details, while also incorporating the imprecision that characterises musical terminology and discourse. A significant attribute of my Fuzzy Logic method is that it traces the trajectory of all musical details, since it is both the individual elements and their combination over time which is significant to the effectiveness of a musical work in achieving its goals. The goal of this work is to find a set of elements and rules, which will ultimately enable the construction of a genralised algorithmic compositional system which can produce expressive music if so desired. }

This paper reports on a method for analysis of piano playing movements. The method allows to judge whether an active movement in a joint has occurred during a given time interval. This time interval may include one or more touches. The problem is complicated by the fact that the mechanical interaction between the arm and piano action generates additional movements that are not under direct control of the player. The analysis method is able to ignore these movements and can therefore be used to provide useful feedback.}

Mmmmm presents a novel way for DJ to become more interactive with their audience andvise versa. The software developed for the N900 mobilephone utilizes the phones built-in accelerometer sensor andBluetooth audio streaming capabilities to mix and apply effects to music using hand gestures and have the mixed audiostream to Bluetooth speakers, which allows the DJ to moveabout the environment and get familiarized with their audience, turning the experience of DJing into an interactiveand audience engaging process. Mmmmm is designed so that the DJ can utilize handgestures and haptic feedback to help them perform the various tasks involved in DJing (mixing, applying effects, andetc). This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an Ambient Tempo Detection mode in which the phones camera is utilized to detect the amount of movement in the environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that should be played. This mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on their performance. The DJ canchoose to utilize these modes of interaction and performance or utilize traditional DJ controls using MmmmmsN900 touch screen based graphics user interface.}

Various sensors and hardware are attached to the body and transmit signals to a workstation, where they are processed using Max/MSP. The game is divided into three levels, each of a different soundscape. The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player's focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state. The system is currently viewed as an interactive installation piece, but future iterations have potential applications in music therapy, bio games, extended performance art, and as a prototype for new interfaces for musical expression. }

Sonic intimacy is important, because voice is one of the highestbandwidth channels for expressing our real and imagined selves.New tools for highly focused spatialization could help improve acoustical clarity, encourage audience engagement, reduce noise pollution and inspire creative expression. We have a particular interest in embodied, embedded systems for vocal performance enhancement and transformation. This short paper describes work in progress on a toolkit for high-quality wearable sound suits. Design goals include tailored directionality and resonance, full bandwidth, and sensible ergonomics. Engineering details to accompany a demonstration of recent prototypes are presented, highlighting a novel magnetostrictive flextensional transducer. Based on initial observations we suggest that vocal acoustic output from the torso, and spatial perception of situated low frequency sources, are two areas deserving greater attention and further study.}

Along the device itself, we present musical interaction principles that are enabled through the aforementioned tactile response. Further variations of the device and perspectives of the friction-based feedback are outlined. }

  abstract = {The American experimental tradition in music emphasizes a process-oriented – rather than goal-oriented – composition style. According to this tradition, the composition process is considered an experiment beginning with a problem resolved by the composer. The noted experimental composer John Cage believed that the artist’s role in composition should be one of coexistence, as opposed to the traditional view of directly controlling the process. Consequently, Cage devel- oped methods of composing that upheld this philosophy by utilizing musical charts and the I Ching, also known as the Chinese Book of Changes. This project investigates these methods and models them via an interactive computer system to explore the use of modern interfaces in experimental composition.}

The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument. }

Some of the more interesting applications demonstrate how the remote hardware can be leveraged for nonstandard uses. In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone. }

An embedded tactile sound transducer creates extra vibrations in the body of the Overtone Fiddle, allowing performer control and sensation via both traditional violin techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared man/machine control of the resulting sound. A magnetic pickup system is mounted to the end of the fiddle's fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded in the body of the instrument back to the pickup. }

We analyze the latency present in several current multi-touch platforms, and we describe a new custom system that reduces latency to an average of 30 ms while providing programmable haptic feed-back to the user.

The first of its kind, Elektrika consists of seven instruments acting as MIDI controllers accompanied by traditional percussion and played by 11 or more performers following Balinese performance practice. Three main percussive instrument designs were executed using a combination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original, the sound andt ravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyond the quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds. It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taught tradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creating opportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar's enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness in Balinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles, ElekTrika challenges performers to trust silent instruments and develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, but through the sound of the whole.}

Being simpler in structure and easier to implement than typical ultrasonic motion detectors with special transducers, this system is robust and offers precise results without introducing any undesired sonic disturbance to users. We describe the design and implementation of Sonicstrument, evaluate its performance, and present two practical applications of the system in music and interactive performance.}

Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music performance by computer. }

The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience's lack of prior exposure to theinstrument and its workings.However, we argue that there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are intendedto be both a tool for creative expression and a creative workof art in themselves, resulting in incompatible requirements.By considering the instrument, the composition and theperformance together as a whole with careful considerationof the rate of learning demanded of the audience, we propose that a lack of transparency can become an asset ratherthan a hindrance. Our approach calls for not only controllerand sound generator to be designed in sympathy with eachother, but composition, performance and physical form too.Identifying three design principles, we illustrate this approach with the Serendiptichord, a wearable instrument fordancers created by the ,

Different techniques for artificial reverberationwill be covered. A multidimensional scaling experimentwas conducted on impulse responses in order to determinehow humans acoustically perceive spatiality. This researchseems to indicate that the perceptual dimensions are related to early energy decay and timbral qualities. Theseresults are applied to a reverberation instrument based ondelay lines. It can be contended that such an instrumentcan be controlled more intuitively than other delay line reverberation tools which often provide a confusing range ofparameters which have a physical rather than perceptualmeaning.}

  abstract = {The use of Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) is suitable to the development of art-creation aid system for beginners. This is because of important features of IEC, like the ability of optimizing with ambiguous evaluation measures, and not requiring special knowledge about art-creation. With the popularity of Consumer Generated Media, many beginners in term of art-creation are interested in creating their own original art works. Thus developing of useful IEC system for musical creation is an urgent task. However, user-assist functions for IEC proposed in pastworks decrease the possibility of getting good unexpected results, which is an important feature of art-creation with IEC. In this paper, The author proposes a new IEC evaluation process named "Shopping Basket" procedure IEC. In the procedure, an user-assist function called Similarity-Based Reasoning allows for natural evaluation by the user. The function reduces user's burden without reducing the possibility of unexpected results. The author performs an experiment where subjects use the new interface to validate it. As a result of the experiment, the author concludes that the new interface is better to motivate users to compose with IEC system than the old interface.}

Such qualities are the density of the generated events per bar, the amount of variation in generation, the amount of syncopation, the metrical strength, and of course the meter itself. The kin.rhythmicator software application was developed to implement this algorithm. During a performance with the kin.rhythmicator the user can control all aspects of the performance through descriptive and intuitive graphic controls. }

The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction, restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated. A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone. However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment. }

The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the "causality" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds' causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that "mimic" a sound's cause and gestures that "trace" a sound'smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound "contours". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.}

However, most of the studies that use physiology based interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and its usage in collaborative scenarios is still in its beginning. In this paper we explore how interactive sonification of brain and heart signals, and its representation through physical objects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhance motivational and controlling aspects of music collaboration. A multimodal system is presented, based on an electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface. Performance and motivation variables were assessed in an experiment involving a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs of participants used two methods for sound creation: implicit interaction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The results showed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control than the Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it. These results support the feasibility of introducing physiology-based interaction in multimodal interfaces for collaborative music generation.}

  abstract = {Computer music systems that coordinate or interact with human musicians exist in many forms. Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document. }

Similar to TCV, the proposed method leverages existing analog turntables as a physical interface to manipulate the playback of digital audio. To doso, however, an accelerometer/gyroscope–equipped smartphone is firmly attached to a modified record, placed on a turntable, and used to sense a performers movement, resulting in a wireless sensing-based scratching method. The accelerometer and gyroscope data is wirelessly transmitted to a computer to manipulate the digital audio playback in real-time. The method provides the benefit of digital audio and storage, requires minimal additional hardware, accommodates familiar proprioceptive feedback, and allows a single interface to control both digital and analog audio. In addition, the proposed method provides numerous additional benefits including real-time graphical display,multi-touch interaction, and untethered performance (e.g“air-scratching”). Such a method turns a vinyl record into an interactive surface and enhances traditional scratching performance by affording new and creative musical interactions. Informal testing show this approach to be viable,responsive, and robust.}

The GRENDL project leverages proven gridcomputing frameworks and approaches the Laptop Orchestra as a distributed computing platform for interactive computer music. This allows us to readily distribute softwareto each laptop in the orchestra depending on the laptop'sinternal configuration, its role in the composition, and theplayer assigned to that computer. Using the SAGA framework, GRENDL is able to distribute software and managesystem and application environments for each composition.Our latest version includes tangible control of the GRENDLenvironment for a more natural and familiar user experience.}

The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative music improvisation games towards ways of mutual play. }

The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance. In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing, sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia musical performance piece. }

  abstract = {In this paper, we describe an implementation of a real-time sound synthesizer using Finite Difference-based simulation of a two-dimensional membrane. Finite Difference (FD) methods can be the basis for physics-based music instrument models that generate realistic audio output. However, such methods are compute-intensive; large simulations cannot run in real time on current CPUs. Many current systems now include powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are a good fit for FD methods. We demonstrate that it is possible to use this method to create a usable real-time audio synthesizer. }

  abstract = {Interacting with musical avatars have been increasingly popular over the years, with the introduction of games likeGuitar Hero and Rock Band. These games provide MIDIequipped controllers that look like their real-world counterparts (e.g. MIDI guitar, MIDI drumkit) that the users playto control their designated avatar in the game. The performance of the user is measured against a score that needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking. The system uses an artificial intelligence approach to implement imitation learning,employing artificial neural networks.}

Previous studies indicated simultaneous music listening and performance is difficult for non-musicians, and that visual support for the task might be helpful. This paper presents results from a preliminary user study conducted to evaluate the effect of visual feedback on a musical tracking task. Participants generated a musical signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter, but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously decreases performance in both dimensions. }

The skeleton data are extracted from users' motions and the data are translated to pre-defined MIDI data. We then use the MIDI data to control several applications. To allow the translation between the data, we implemented a simple Kinect-to-MIDI data convertor, which is introduced in this paper. We describe two applications to make music with Kinect: we first generate sound with Max/MSP, and then control the adlib with our own adlib generating system by the body movements of the users. }

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new research direction for the large family of instrumental musical interfaces where sound is generated using digital granular synthesis, and where interaction and control involve the (fine) operation of stiff, flat contact surfaces. First, within a historical context, a general absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda. }

  abstract = {In this paper we introduce a multimodal platform for Hybrid Reality live performances: by means of non-invasiveVirtual Reality technology, we developed a system to presentartists and interactive virtual objects in audio/visual choreographies on the same real stage. These choreographiescould include spectators too, providing them with the possibility to directly modify the scene and its audio/visual features. We also introduce the first interactive performancestaged with this technology, in which an electronic musician played live five tracks manipulating the 3D projectedvisuals. As questionnaires have been distributed after theshow, in the last part of this work we discuss the analysisof collected data, underlining positive and negative aspectsof the proposed experience.This paper belongs together with a performance proposalcalled Dissonance, in which two performers exploit the platform to create a progressive soundtrack along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment.}

We found that even highly computer-literate composers use an iterative process that begins with expressing musical ideas on paper, followed by active parallel exploration on paper and in software, prior to final execution of their ideas as an original score. We conducted a participatory design study that focused on the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a technology probe that connects users' hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically. }

Moreover, we presenta multitouch tabletop application, developed with a groupof DJ consultants to ensure an adequate implementation ofthe traditional gesture lexicon.To conclude, we conduct an expert evaluation, with tenDJ users in which we compare the three DJ setups with ourprototype. The study revealed that our proposal suits expectations of Club/Radio-DJs, but fails against the mentalmodel of Scratch-DJs, due to the lack of haptic feedback torepresent the record's physical rotation. Furthermore, testsshow that our multitouch DJ setup, reduces task durationwhen compared with Virtual setups.}

  abstract = {The use of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental arts is not a novel concept. Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one's mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware. }

This opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed atARTeM [2]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player, toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that would disturb the performer. Weused those sensors in several performances with a dancingviola player and in one where she was simultaneously controlling gas flames interactively. We are currently applyingthem to other types of musical performances.}

This development has made a great impact in changing the procedures for composing and producing music within my genre without necessarily changing the strategies of how the technology is used. The transition from analogue to digital sound technology not only opened up new ways of manipulating and manoeuvring sound, it also opened up challenges in how to integrate and control the digital sound technology as a seamless part of my musical genre. By using techniques and methods known from electro-acoustic/computer music, and adapting them for use within my tradition, this research aims to find new strategies for composing and producing music within my genre. }

The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.}

Mobile instruments are extended by means of relational descriptors democratically controlled by the group and mapped to sound parameters. A qualitative evaluation approach is described and a user test with participants playing in groups of three conducted. The results of the analysis show core-categories such as familiarity with instrument and situation, shift of focus in activity, family of interactions and different categories of the experience emerging from the interviews. Our evaluation shows the suitability of our approach but also the need for iterating on our design on the basis of the perspectives brought forth by the users. This latter observation confirms the importance of conducting a thorough interview session followed by data analysis on the line of grounded theory.}

The interesting outcome of such an examination is that the actual instrument is the space of sound characteristics, through which the performer navigates with gestures captured by various input devices. We will take a look at different types of interaction modes and controllers (positional, inertial, audio analysis) and the gestures they afford, and provide a critical assessment of their musical and expressive capabilities, based on several years of musical experience, performing with the CataRT system for real-time CBCS.}

In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other's melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ''listening applications''.}

Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it, approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use --the XY pad and button grid --illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently being used to assess the validity of this approach.}

The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance.
The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.}

Initial formal analysis of this material sheds light on the fluidity of composer, performer and designer roles within the ensemble and shows how confluences of these roles constitute member's differing viewpoints. We go on to draw out a number of strands of interaction that highlight the essentially complex, socially constructed and value driven nature of the group's practice and conclude by reviewing the implications of these factors on the design of software tools for laptop ensembles.}

These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems.
The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.}

We introduce tangible speech synthesis as an alternate way of envisioning how artificial speech content can be produced. Tangible speech synthesis refers to the ability, for a given system, to provide some physicality and interactivity to important speech production parameters. We present MAGE, our new software platform for high-quality reactive speech synthesis, based on statistical parametric modeling and more particularly hidden Markov models. We also introduce a new HandSketch-based musical instrument. This instrument brings pen and posture based interaction on the top of MAGE, and demonstrates a first proof of concept.}

There were marked differences between the groups regarding focus, in that the participants in blindfolded group tended to focus on fewer aspects, have a heightened focus and be less distracted than the seeing group. The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions. This study also shows that there were only minor differences between the groups regarding the experience of skill and control, and argues that this observation can be explained by earlier research on skill in NIMEs.}

This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors' Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and `site' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.}

The originality of this interaction is threefold. First, it covers the whole interaction cycle from the input (the dancer's movements) to the output (the generated music). Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.}

Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.}

  abstract = {The Highland piping tradition requires the performer to learn and accurately reproduce a diverse array of ornaments, which can be a daunting prospect to the novice piper. This paper presents a system which analyses a player's technique using sensor data obtained from an electronic bagpipe chanter interface. Automatic recognition of a broad range of piping embellishments allows real-time visual feedback to be generated, enabling the learner to ensure that they are practicing each movement correctly.
The electronic chanter employs a robust and responsive infrared (IR) sensing strategy, and uses audio samples from acoustic recordings to produce a high quality bagpipe sound. Moreover, the continuous nature of the IR sensors offers the controller a considerable degree of flexibility, indicating sig-nificant potential for the inclusion of extended and novel techniques for musical expression in the future.}

This sensate surface is based on c onductive inkjet printing technology which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and connections between electronics components to be printed onto a large roll of flexible substrate that is unrestricted in length. The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can ``cut'' out their desired shapes, ``paste'' the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one's music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.}

The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor-mal workshops.}

The Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework and Csikszentmihalyi's flow theory are combined to demonstrate how non-realtime, notation-mediated interaction can support focused, immersive, energetic, and intrinsically-rewarding musical experiences, and to what extent they are supported in the interfaces of music production software. Users are shown to maintain liveness through a rapid, iterative edit-audition cycle that integrates audio and visual feedback.}

In all three of these cases, detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured in real-time. We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a ``surrogate'' sensor. Some initial results comparing different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.}

Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.}

In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities.
In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.}

It removes the confusion that results from page turns, aides a musician's return to the proper location in the music score after the looking at the conductor and notifies musicians of conductor instructions. MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system.
There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.}

He was never able to perform the piece with those forces, however, due to his inability to synchronize multiple pianolas. Thus all performances of the piece in his lifetime, and for decades after, were done with a single pianola or player piano.*
The author traces the origin of the concept of synchronizing multiple pianolas, and explains the attendant technological issues. He examines attempts to synchronize mechanical pianos and other time-based devices at the time of Ballet m{\'e}canique's composition, and suggests that Antheil's vision for his piece was not as farfetched as has long been thought.}

Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.}

Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction with this kind of interfaces, and in particular with the tangible tabletop instrument Reactable . In this paper we present a system based on a circular array of me-chanically intercoupled force sensing resistors used to obtain a low-latency, affordable, and easily embeddable hardware system able to detect surface impacts and pressures on the tabletop perimeter. We also consider the option of com-pleting this detected gestural information with the sound information coming from a contact microphone attached to the mechanical coupling layer, to control physical modelling synthesis of percussion instruments.}

Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration).
Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules [1]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow[2].
This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers [3].}

This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record, visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.}

These voltages are used to control complex sound engines in an analogue modular synthesizer. Both the voltage field and the tap electrodes can be moved freely. The design was inspired by previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is cheap to build, and provides flexible control over a large set of parameters. It is musically satisfying to play, and allows for a wide range of playing techniques, from wild exploration to subtle expressions. I also present an inven-tory of the available playing techniques, motivated by the interface design, musically, conceptually and theatrically. The performance aspects of the interface are also discussed. The interface has been used in a number of performances in Sweden and Japan in 2011, and is also used by other musicians.}

Although there are many opportunities to shape the amplitude envelope before loudspeaker amplification, they are all governed by the ever-decaying physical vibra-tions of the tone generating mechanism. A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011.
In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat-ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.}

This result shows that force input is a potentially feasible for browsing through a vowel space for an articulatory voice synthesis system, although further evaluation is required.}

  abstract = {We present Patchwerk, a networked synthesizer module with tightly coupled web browser and tangible interfaces. Patchwerk connects to a pre-existing modular synthesizer using the emerging cross-platform HTML5 WebSocket standard to enable low-latency, high-bandwidth, concurrent control of analog signals by multiple users. Online users control physical outputs on a custom-designed cabinet that reflects their activity through a combination of motorized knobs and LEDs, and streams the resultant audio. In a typical installation, a composer creates a complex physical patch on the modular synth that exposes a set of analog and digital parameters (knobs, buttons, toggles, and triggers) to the web-enabled cabinet. Both physically present and online audiences can control those parameters, simultane-ously seeing and hearing the results of each other's actions. By enabling collaborative interaction with a massive analog synthesizer, Patchwerk brings a broad audience closer to a rare and historically important instrument. Patchwerk is available online at http://synth.media.mit.edu.}

  abstract = {Hyper-instruments extend traditional acoustic instruments with sensing technologies that capture digitally subtle and sophisticated aspects of human performance. They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.}

By using NDEF, developers will have an eas-ier time managing nodes and their messages, especially for scenarios in which a single application or interface controls multiple sound engines. NDEF is currently implemented in the JunctionBox interaction toolkit but could easily be implemented in other toolkits.}

AuRal is an environmental audio system in which individual participants form ad hoc ensembles based on geolocation and affect the overall sound of the music associated with the location that they are in.
The AuRal environment binds physical location and the choices of multiple, simultaneous performers to act as the generative force of music tied to the region. Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music. As a result, walking through the same location at different times results in unique collaborative listening experiences.}

Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces' affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.}

As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.}

This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.}

Then, a central composing and conducting application running on a local interactive display, called Vuzik. Finally, a network protocol to synchronize the two. ChoirMob musicians can perform music together at any location where they can connect to a Vuzik central conducting device displaying a composed piece of music. We explored this system by creating a chamber choir of ChoirMob performers, consisting of both experienced musicians and novices, that performed in rehearsals and live concert scenarios with music composed using the Vuzik interface.}

The resulting environment infrastructure -coupled with the Boys & Girls Club of Southwest Virginia Satellite Linux Laptop Orchestra -offers opportunities for students to design and build original instruments, master them through a series of rehearsals, and ultimately utilize them as part of an ensemble in a performance of a predetermined piece whose parameters are coordinated by instructor through an embedded networked module. The ensuing model will serve for the assessment and development of a stronger connection with content-area standards and the development of creative thinking and collaboration skills.}

The various controllers are designed to be very easy and intuitive so anyone can pick one up and quickly be able to play it.

This initial foray into designing an audio-visual computerbased instrument for improvisational performance in a planetarium builds on prior, successful work in mapping the rules and state of two-dimensional computer board games to improvised computer music. The unique visual and audio geometries of the planetarium present challenges and opportunities. The game tessellates the dome in mobile, colored hexagons that emulate both atoms and musical scale intervals in an expanding universe. Spatial activity in the game maps to spatial locale and instrument voices in the speakers, in essence creating a virtual orchestra with a string section, percussion section, etc. on the dome. Future work includes distribution of game play via mobile devices to permit attendees to participate in a performance. This environment is open-ended, with great educational and aesthetic potential.}

The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.}

The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.}

This system learns mappings by presenting a sequence of sounds to the user and correlating the gain in each frequency band with the user's preference rating. The system speeds learning through transfer learning. Results on a study of 35 participants show how an effective, personalized audio manipulation tool can be automatically built after only three ratings from the user.}

It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical interfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, drawing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sciences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances traditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.}

  abstract = {Mapping between musical interfaces, and sound engines, is integral to the nature of an interface [3]. Traditionally, musical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor' to create a local coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer's small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces [1].}

The sounds are transduced by a piezoelectric sensor inside the wooden body, so any tactile contact with TedStick is transmitted as audio and further processed by a computer. The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it-self. This is done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo-cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.}

Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces.

In recent years,several rare archives of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata --- some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher'sunderstanding of the data.}

It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI's performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI's sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow. We also provide a schedulingalgorithm built upon that framework that guarantees desirable properties forthe resulting DMI.}

The phases ofarticulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can bedriven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the syntheticphoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmicpatterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. Theinstrument features two (augmented) pen tablets for controlling voiceproduction: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second oneis dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very naturalconsonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms theeffectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument.}

One important task is evaluating the mood of acomposition for evoking accurate associations and memories of a soundscape. Anew system that uses supervised machine learning is presented for theacquisition and realtime feedback of soundscape affect. A model of sound-scape mood is created by users entering evaluations of audio environmentsusing a mobile device. The same device then provides feedback to the user ofthe predicted mood of other audio environments. We used a features vector ofTotal Loudness and MFCC extracted from an audio signal to build a multipleregression models. The evaluation of the system shows the tool is effective inpredicting soundscape affect.}

In particular, the fingering of the left hand comprises various relationshipsbetween the finger and the string, such as a finger touching the strings, afinger pressing the strings, and a finger releasing the strings. The recognition of the precise fingering of the left hand is applied to aself-learning support system, which is able to detect strings being muted by afinger, and which transcribes music automatically, including the details offingering techniques. Therefore, the goal of our study is the construction of a system forrecognizing the touch of strings for the guitar. We propose a method for recognizing the touch of strings based on theconductive characteristics of strings and frets. We develop a prototype system, and evaluate its effectiveness.Furthermore, we propose an application which utilizes our system.}

This paper proposes a new algorithm, based on an adaptiveattraction mapping, for improving initial pitch accuracy with touch userinterfaces with continuous control. At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point. Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained, allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results of experimentscomparing the users' pitch accuracy with and without the help of the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player. Therefore, thedynamic mapping algorithm allows for a clean and accurate attack when playing touch user interfaces for controlling continuous pitch instruments like voicesynthesizers.}

The system shows three windows; a fingerposition window for visualization of finger position, a score window fordiagnosing finger position along the score and command prompt window forshowing states of system and advices. Finally, we evaluated the system by anexperiment. The experimental group improved accuracy values about fingerpositions and also improved accuracy of pitches of sounds compared withcontrol group.

The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom data series of di_x000B_erent orbits from an speci_x000C_c dynami-cal system. Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that result with a _x000C_xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci_x000C_c and independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements. The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate di_x000B_erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating those values from orbits into a wellde_x000C_ned and coherent general system. Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe created panning trajectories.}

The smart tangibles developed for this interface are able to sense howthey are grasped by the user. The paper presents the design of the mixing interface including the smart tangible as well as a preliminary user study involving a hands-on focus group session where 5 different control technologiesare contrasted and discussed. Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibles were preferred, but that an optimal interface would include a combination of touch, smart tangibles and an extra function control tangible for extending the functionality of the smart tangibles. Finally, the interface should incorporate both an edit and mix mode---the latter displaying very limited visual feedback in order to force users to focus their attention to listening instead of the interface.}

Finally, we evaluate the instrument considering the performer and the audience, which are two of the most important stakeholders involved in the use, conception, and perception of a musical device. The results achieved are encouraging and led to useful insights about how to improve instrument features, performance and usability.}

The focus of this paper is on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer's objective is to guide the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.}

However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency contentof the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in ourexperience are the most useful filters for our target application.}

A music performance can be described with compositional and expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we often observe particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a "gesture", since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuming a finite number of latent states on each property value changes, we can describe those gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train them by unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us a measure for different effects of each properties on the gesture implementation. Test result on some of real performances indicates that the trained models could capture the structure of gestures observed in the given performances, and detect their boundaries. The entropy-based measure was informative to understand the effectiveness of each property on the gesture implementation. Test result on large corpora indicates that our model has potentials for afurther model improvement.}

In comparison, the hands have shown an impressive ability to mastercomplex motor tasks through feel. The hand controller uses both modes ofinteraction. Electro-magnetic field tracking enables 6D hand motion trackingwhile two options provide tactile interaction- a set of tracks that providelinear positioning and applied finger pressure, or a set of trumpet like sliderkeys that provide continuous data describing key depth. Thumbs actuateadditional pressure sensitive buttons. The two haptic interfaces are mountedto a comfortable hand grip that allows a significant range of reach, andpressure to be applied without restricting hand movement highly desirable inexpressive motion.}

  abstract = {Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs) .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging. One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.}

The mPoi project and its concepts will be introducedfirst and then its interaction with a performer will be discussed.The mPoi project seeks to develop a prototype for a set of mobile musicalinstrument based on electronic motion sensors and circuit boards. Thistechnology is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance, which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music. The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software, which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate theperformer's gesture into sound. A unique algorithm was developed to extractfeatures of the swing motion and translate them into various patterns of sound.}

Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.}

Weutilize optical sensors to track the continuous position displacementvalues of the three trumpet valves. These values are trasmittedwirelessly and can be used by an external controller. The hardware hasbeen designed to be reconfigurable by having the housing 3D printed sothat the dimensions can be adjusted for any particular trumpetmodel. The result is a low cost, low power, easily replicable sensorsolution that offers any trumpeter the ability to augment their ownexisting trumpet without compromising the instrument's structure orplaying technique. The extended digital control afforded by our systemis interweaved with the natural playing gestures of an acoustictrumpet.

The relative activity between different types of activity isassessed in order to identify trends. The classification according totechnological, social or geographic showed an overwhelming bias to thetechnological, followed by social investigations. An alternative classificationof survey product, or artifact reveals an increase in the number of productsdescribed with a corresponding decline in the number of surveys and artisticprojects. The increase in technical papers appears to be due to an enthusiasmto make use of increased capability of mobile phones, although there are signsthat the initial interest has already peaked, and researchers are againinterested to explore technologies and artistic expression beyond existingmobile phones.}

In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.}

However, the visualisation and triggeringof lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely limiting the artist's freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.}

General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.}

We make an unconventional use of the Self-Organizing Maps to obtain only a geometrical transformation of the gestural data, while dimensionality reduction is handled separately. We introduce a novel training procedure to overcome two main Self-Organizing Maps limitations which otherwise corrupt the interface usability. As evaluation, we apply this method to our existing Voice-Controlled Interface for musical instruments, obtaining sensible usability improvements.}

Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.}

The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limited square isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challenge in the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging note actuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrument design. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphism can be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (as well as composer and performer) to "lock in" to a single isomorphism, or to have a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix (an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musical instruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphic instruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide variety of different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embedded with RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphism currently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments/experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments.}

It differs most notably from standard ventures into thedesign of novel musical interfaces and installations in its reliance onuser-centric methodologies borrowed from the field of Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI). Not only does this research enable us to closely examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore newinterpretations of the network as a performance space. This paper describes themotivation and background behind our project, the work that has been undertakentowards its realization and the future steps that have yet to be explored.}

It is hoped that the techniques described in this paper afford performers and composers an enhanced level of creative expression in the diffusion performance practice. This paper introduces and evaluates tactile.space, a multi-touch performance interface for diffusion built on the BrickTable. It describes how tactile.space implements Vector Base Amplitude Panning to achieve real-time source positioning. The final section of this paper presents the findings of a userstudy that was conducted by those who performed with the interface, evaluating the interface as a performance tool with a focus on the increased creative expression the interface affords, and directly comparing it to the traditional diffusion user interface.}

To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians' comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the 'in-space' response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the 'on-body' mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers.

The first one, called The Counterpointer, takes a melody input from the user and responds by generating voices based on the rules of eighteenth--century counterpoint. The second one is based on a recent treatise on harmony and counterpoint by music theorist Dmitri Tymoczco: El Ordenador lets users explore a set of features of tonality by constraining randomly generated music according to one or more of them. El Ordenador gives the user less control than The Counterpointer, but more than La Mec{\'a}nica, the third sequencer in the series. La Mec{\'a}nica plays back the sequences generated by El Ordenador using a punch-card reading music box mechanism.

A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer's gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score, as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for the performer. Many compositional and technological approaches used in this project pay tribute to composer John Cage, since the premiere performance of Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer took place in 2012, the centennial celebration of Cage's birth year.}

Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one's musical craft. These skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community, it's unclear that we should even draw distinctions between 'artist' and 'technician', because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However, what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will be presented. It enables one to bypass the technical hurdles listed above in favor of immediate experimentation with musical practice and wireless sensing. A unique software architecture will also be unveiled that enables one to quickly and intuitively process and map unpredictable numbers and types of wireless data streams, the Digital Data Workstation.}

Orphion achieves this by incorporating an interaction model based on tonally tuned virtual ``pads'' in user-configurable layouts, where the pitch and timbre associated with each pad depends on the initial point of touch, touch point size and size variation, and position after the initial touch. These parameters control a physical model for sound generation with visual feedback provided via the iPad display. We present findings from the research and development process including design revisions made in response to user testing. Finally, conclusions are made about the effectiveness of the instrument based on large-scale user feedback.}

  abstract = {Music jamming is an extremely difficult task for musical novices. Trying to extend this meaningful activity, which can be highly enjoyable, to a larger recipient group, we present WIJAM, a mobile application for an ad-hoc group of musical novices to perform improvisation along with a music master. In this ``master-players'' paradigm, the master offers a music backing, orchestrates the musical flow, and gives feedbacks to the players; the players improvise by tapping and sketching on their smartphones. We believe that this paradigm can be a significant contribution to the possibility of music playing by a group of novices with no instrumental training leading to decent musical results.}

In this paper, we describe how ideas of prehistoric collective music making inspired and guided this participatory musical work, both in terms of how it was created and the audience experience of musical collaboration we aimed to create in the final installation. Following a detailed description of the installation itself, we reflect on the successes, lessons and future challenges of encouraging creative musical collaboration among members of an audience.}

By using the movement classification result not as a direct control action in itself, but as a way to change mapping spaces and musical sections, the control possibilities offered by the simple interface are greatly increased.}

Digital vinyl systems combine the distinct haptic nature of the analog turntable with the advantages of digital media. They use special records containing a digital timecode which is then processed by a computer and mapped to properties like playback speed and direction. These records, however, are generic and, in contrast to traditional vinyl, do not provide visual cues representing the structure of the track. We present a system that augments the timecode record with a visualization of song information such as artist, title, and track length, but also with a waveform that allows to visually navigate to a certain beat. We conducted a survey examining the acceptance of such tools in the DJ community and conducted a user study with professional DJs. The system was widely accepted as a tool in the DJ community and received very positive feedback during observational mixing sessions with four professional DJs.}

The sponge itself is described, but the main focus is on the evolution of the mapping strategies that are used. The author reviews the guidelines proposed by other researchers and explains how they were concretely applied with the sponge. He concludes that no single strategy constitutes a solution to the issue of mapping and that musical compositions are complex entities that require the use of a multitude of mapping strategies in parallel. It is hoped that the mappings described combined with new strategies will eventually lead to the emergence of a musical language that is idiomatic to the sponge.}

A three-dimensional distribution derived from feature-analysis becomes accessible through a theremin-inspired interface, allowing the player to shift from exploration and intuitive navigation toward embodied performance on a granular level. In our example we illustrate this concept by using the audiovisual recording of an instrumental performance as a source. Our system provides an alternative interface to the musical instrument's audiovisual corpus: as the instrument's sound and behavior is accessed in ways that are not possible on the instrument itself, the resulting non-linear playback of the grains generates an instant remix in a cut-up aesthetic. The presented instrument is a human-computer interface that employs the structural outcome of machine analysis accessing audiovisual corpora in the context of a musical performance.}

Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instrument and the dynamical mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary, materialoriented approaches to composition and particularly to free improvisation where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest, and the process of exploration and discovery is an important part of the practice. Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.}

Much like a traditional signal chain, the user can choose a series of effects and offer realtime control to their various parameters. In this work, we introduce a means of creating tree-like signal graphs that dynamically change their routing in response to changes in the location of the unit generators in a virtual space. Signals are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do the decision making.}

Our method relies on two advances in machine learning. First, metric learning allows the user to shape the audio feature space to match their own preferences. Second, kernelized sorting finds an optimal arrangement for the samples in 2D. We demonstrate our system with two new interfaces for exploring audio samples, and evaluate the technology qualitatively and quantitatively via a pair of user studies.}

In addition, participants can change master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have been developed in electronic music field [1][2][3]. The authors are interested in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface: Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre, and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3) Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability. In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization. In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer musical sessions.}

  abstract = {For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already `play' their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch) with the player's hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player's hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz [TAPIR article]. This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor. From the generator that is attached on the player's hand, the TAPIR signal transfers to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player's gesture is captured as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer on aforementioned system.}

Finger location on a violin fingerboard is measured using resistive sensors, allowing rapid detection of approximate pitch. The initial pitch estimate is then used to restrict the search space of an audio pitch tracking algorithm. Most audio-only pitch tracking algorithms face a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and latency, with longer analysis windows producing better pitch estimates at the cost of noticeable lag in a live performance environment. Conversely, sensor-only strategies struggle to achieve the fine pitch accuracy a human listener would expect. By combining the two approaches, high accuracy and low latency can be simultaneously achieved.}

This approach utilizes Max/MSP to allow any player an easy and low cost way to apply and experiment innovative music interfaces for live performance, without losing the professionalism required on stage. In that approach, every 1-3 players is plugged to a unit consisting of a standard sound-card and laptop. This unit is controlled by an interface that schedules and manages all the digital sounds made by each player (VST effects, VST instruments and 'home-made' interactive interfaces). All the player's units are then remotely controlled by a conductor patch which is in charge of the synchronization of all the players and background samples in real time, as well as providing sensitive metronome and scheduling visual enhancement. Moreover, and not less important, we can take the advantage of using virtual instruments and virtual effects in Max environment to manage the mix, and routing the audio. This providing monitors and metronome to the players ears, and virtual mixing via Max/MSP patch. This privilege almost eliminates the dependency in the venue's equipment, and in that way, the sound quality and music ideas can be taken out directly from the studio to the stage.}

Such a technique is useful for robots consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented method consists of comparing a detuned string's pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications and ideas for subsequent work on self-tuning musical robotic systems.}

There have been many examples of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms themselves, or programming or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the Sound Analyser an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.}

The results show that 'gesture' is in fact used in 62 % of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support the claim that 'gesture' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control to quite metaphorical applications.}

Following these criteria, we literally incorporated a musical score onto the surface of the instrument as a way of continuously controlling several parameters of the sound synthesis. Tangible Scores are played with both hands and they can adopt multiple physical forms. Complex and expressive sound textures can be easily played over a variety of timbres, enabling precise control in a natural manner.}

For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken, our setup will then listen to a human drummer's performance pattern, analyze for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations of our constructed system.}

When compared with their physical counterparts, current control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty. This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth's interaction design, and user experience results of using such an interface.}

Following the paradigm of spreadsheets, an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays, iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else). In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.}

  abstract = {We present the FingerSynth, a wearable musical instrument made up of a bracelet and set of rings that enable its player to produce sound by touching nearly any surface in their environment. Each ring contains a small, independently controlled exciter transducer commonly used for auditory bone conduction. The rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise. When a wearer touches their own (or someone else's) head, the contacted person hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery. The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making music with everything they touch.}

Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical notes. Some artists who introduce automated music performance operate parameters of the sound in their performance for production of their music. In this paper, we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation of the sound parameters via computer. Further, in this study, the probability distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed the possibilities of our method.}

  abstract = {Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances. With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer's signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device achieving a latency of <3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving a net throughput of ~4800 packets per second (~320 per device); where each packet is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the device.}

Performances with a prototype gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from a performer's perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship, centred around a growing understanding of the body's physical and creative potential. For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.}

An array of hall-effect sensors and their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium. These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial resolution and its low-latency (<1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward to integrate into any setup.}

The OWL is a dedicated, programmable audio device designed to provide an alternative to the use of laptop computers for bespoke audio processing on stage for music performance. By creating a software framework that allows the user to program their own code for the hardware in C++, the OWL project makes it possible to use homemade audio processing on stage without the need for a laptop running a computer music environment such as Pure Data or Supercollider. Moving away from the general-purpose computer to a dedicated audio device means that some of the potential problems and technical complexity of performing with a laptop computer onstage can be avoided, allowing the user to focus more of their attention on the musical performance. Within the format of a traditional guitar 'stomp box', the OWL aims to integrate seamlessly into a guitarist's existing pedal board setup, and in this way presents as an example of a ubiquitous and tangible computing device -a programmable computer designed to fit into an existing mode of musical performance whilst being transparent in use.}

Following this we describe the development of a specific sonic character, mapping approach and performance. In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance. In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed. Further, the utility of a movement focused design approach is discussed.}

The second, a music mashup system, determines the compatibility between beat-synchronous chromagrams from different pieces of music.

This paper examines the possibility of adding a visual feedback to help the public understanding, and add expressivity to the performance. It explores the various mapping organizations between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters, or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation of controllers, received a good opinion from the audience, highlighting the musical intention of the performers.}

Ten musicians of varying background were given a deliberately constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor, speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video, sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the exploration of the instrument's affordances; this suggested the presence of a dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated the process of appropriation across the two groups of participants.}

Several causes could explain this reality, among them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument. In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance. Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements. For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.}

The experiment was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: ``Sonic Zoom''. Participants were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the ``convergent'' stage of creation. The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the ``divergent'' aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both 2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable, separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent tasks.}

The system not only aims to reflect emotional states but to direct and induce emotional states through the real-time generation of the score, highlighting the potential of direct neural-emotional manipulation in live performance. The EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features within the EEG. We measure the two emotional descriptors, valence and arousal, within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively, whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals' emotional states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the two responses together. This work highlights the potential available in affecting neural-emotional manipulation within live performance and demonstrates a new approach to real-time, affectively-driven composition.}

While object-based audio production has proven to reduce the dependency on loudspeaker configurations, authoring tools are still considered to be difficult to interact with in current production environments. In this paper, we investigate the issues of spatialization techniques for object-based audio production and introduce the Spatial Audio Design Spaces (SpADS) framework, that provides insights into the spatial manipulation of object-based audio. Based on interviews with professional sound engineers, this morphological analysis clarifies the relationships between recording and rendering techniques that define audio-objects for 3D speaker configurations, allowing the analysis and the design of advanced object-based controllers as well.}

As an interactive tool involved in music production the score system itself undergoes a functional transformation and becomes a distributed meta-instrument in its own right, independent from, yet intrinsically connected to those instruments held by the performers.}

A series of musical pieces have been composed for the interface following cueing strategies. In addition a second display, ``the prompter'' guides the users through the piece. 3DinMotion has been developed from scratch and natively, leading to a system with a very low latency, making it suitable for real time music interactions. In addition, 3DinMotion is fully compatible with the OpenSoundControl (OSC) protocol, allowing expansion to commonly used musical and sound design applications.}

Upon being given a new tracing, the system segments the tracing and computes a final phrase that best approximates the tracing.}

We propose a concept that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices. We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins", which can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.}

We lay out a conceptual framework for the exploration of hybrid resonant assemblages and describe how we have approached implementing them. Our performance experience is presented and implications for work are discussed. In the light of our work, we urge a reconsideration of the implicit norms of performance which underlie much research in NIME.

The timbre morphing system is used to transform live input captured at each sculpture with a discrete microphone array, by morphing towards noisy source signals that have been associated with each sculpture as part of a pre-determined musical structure. The resulting morphed audio is then fed-back to the gallery via a five-channel speaker array. Visitors are encouraged to walk freely through the installation and interact with the sound world, creating unique audio morphs based on their own movements, voices, and incidental sounds.}

In addition to a concert version, this paper also describes an interactive installation based on the same hardware.}

This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile environments and continuous coupling of users' audible actions with sonically augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with some future research directions based on the prototypes and proposes several other potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.}

Similarly, computer ensembles resort to a conductor to keep the synchronization and structural coordination of the performance, often with the assistance of software. Achieving integration and coherence in a networked performance, however, can be challenging in certain scenarios. This is the case for configurations with a high degree of mutual interdependence and shared control. This paper focuses on the design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective instruments. We propose a novel conductor dimension space representation for collective instruments, which takes into account both its social and structural features. We present a case study of a collective instrument implementing a software conductor. Finally, we discuss the implications of human and machine conduction schemes in the context of the proposed dimension space.}

We use convolution to excite the grains from the corpus via the microphone input, capturing the contact interaction sounds, which allows articulation of the corpus by hitting, scratching, or strumming a surface with various parts of the hands or objects. We also show how changes of grains have to be carefully handled, how one can smoothly interpolate between neighbouring grains, and finally evaluate the system against previous attempts.}

  abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced sonic data communication method using TAPIR (Theoretically Audible, but Practically Inaudible Range: frequencies above 18kHz) sound and a software toolkit as its implementation. Using inaudible sound as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional hardware. ``TAPIR Sound Tag'' is a smart device framework for inaudible data communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of 200 bps can be achieved, enabling peer-to-peer or broadcasting real-time data communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication. Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative completion of an artist's work by audience. We expect this framework to provide a new way of audience interaction to artists, as well as further promoting audience participation by simplifying the process: using personal smart devices as a medium and not requiring additional hardware or complex settings.}

  abstract = {Many musical interfaces have used the musical conductor metaphor, allowing users to control the expressive aspects of a performance by imitating the gestures of conductors. In most of them, the rules to control these expressive aspects are predefined and users have to adapt to them. Other works have studied conductors' gestures in relation to the performance of the orchestra. The goal of this study is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.}

Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself' approach described by the design herein. While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that is widely available online for approximately $200 USD. This serves as the starting point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist. Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development of a complete quartet of instruments.}

Participants were asked to improvise music on {SoundXY4: The Art of Noise}, a tabletop system that includes sound samples inspired by Russolo's taxonomy of noises. We compared spatialisation vs. no-spatialisation conditions, and findings suggest that, when using spatialisation, there was a clearer workspace awareness, and a greater engagement in the musical activity as an immersive experience.}

This approach has been applied in a master course focused on the exploration of expressiveness and on the role of the mapping component in the NIME creation chain, through hands-on and self-reflective approach based on a restrictive setup consisting of smart-phones and the Pd programming language. Working Groups were formed, and a 2-step DMI design process was applied, including 2 performance stages. The evaluation tools assessed both System and Performance aspects of each project, according to Listeners' impressions after each performance. Listeners' previous music knowledge was also considered. Through this methodology, students with different backgrounds were able to effectively engage in the NIME design processes, developing working DMI prototypes according to the demanded requirements; the assessment tools proved to be consistent for evaluating NIMEs systems and performances, and the fact of informing the design processes with the outcome of the evaluation, showed a traceable progress in the students outcomes.}

Experio allows for multiple audience participants influencing the musical performance through dance, facilitated by a musical moderator using a tailored interface.

The purpose of the mappings is to enable visual control of corpus-based concatenative synthesis. More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis revealed no significant differences in the participant's responses between the three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences in the ability of the participants' to detect the correct image depending on which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success rate of the participant responses.}

In this study we try to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar. We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their 2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed that children with hemiplegia were able to play the actuated guitar by producing rhythmical movement across the strings that enables them to enter a world of music they so often see as closed.}

Initial investigations have been made into digitallycontrolled physical actuation of the acoustic tines. An embedded Linux micro-computer supplants the laptop. A piezoelectric pickup is mounted to the underside of the body of the instrument for direct audio acquisition providing a robust signal with little interference. The signal is used for electric sound-reinforcement, creative signal processing and audio analysis developed in Puredata (Pd). This signal inputs and outputs the micro computer via stereo 1/8th inch phono jacks. Sensors provide gesture recognition affording the performer a broader, more dynamic range of musical human computer interaction (MHCI) over specific DSP functions. Work has been done toward electromagnetic actuation of the tines, aiming to allow performer control and sensation via both traditional Lamellophone techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared human/computer control of the resulting sound. The goal is to achieve this without compromising the traditional sound production methods of the acoustic instrument while leveraging inherent performance gestures with embedded continuous controller values essential to MHCI. The result is an intuitive, performer designed, hybrid electro-acoustic instrument, idiomatic computer interface, and robotic acoustic instrument in one framework.}

The apparatus is placed on an overhead projector and a visual presentation of these rhythmic patterns is delivered as a shadow play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of the robot, through direct physical interaction with the robot, by rewiring the internal connectivity, and by adjusting internal parameters. The theory of embodied cognition provides the theoretical basis of this device. The core postulate of embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism's nervous system, the organism's body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas and it is effectively possible to play with it at all the three levels, the electronics, the physical configuration of the robot and the environment.}

  abstract = {Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences. Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover, soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music that directly respond to people's movements through space. In light of these trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process from a composer's perspective by presenting `from the field' an account of how they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public sculpture park. We chart a composer's rationale as they developed a soundtrack for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre, rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that we intend to guide future practice and research.}

We present PiaF (Piano Follower), a prototype for augmenting piano performance by measuring gesture variations. We survey other augmented piano projects, several of which focus on gestural recognition, and present our prototype which uses machine learning techniques for gesture classification and estimation of gesture variations in real-time. Our implementation uses the Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data. During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures, or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time, and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond live performance, including pedagogy and embodiment of recorded performance.}

These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous, but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study where participants perform ``air-drumming'' gestures in time to rhythmic sounds. These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.}

Inspired by the Touch{\'e} project, this paper discusses how to implement this technique using the community standard hardware Arduino instead of custom designed electronics. The technique requires only passive components and can be used to enhance the touch sensitivity of many everyday objects and even biological materials and substances such as plants, which this paper will focus on as a case study through the project known as Cultivating Frequencies. This paper will discuss different techniques of filtering data captured by this system, different methods for creating gesture recognition unique to the object being used, and the implications of this technology as it pertains to the goal of ubiquitous sensing. Furthermore, this paper will introduce a new Arduino Library, SweepingCapSense, which simplifies the coding required to implement this technique.}

The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once recognised, these virtual instruments can then be played by the user in real time. The size of a sketched instrument shape is used to control certain parameters of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras containing many different shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the next steps for the system design.}

For the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software, whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger scale project investigating the effect of social structures on the musical output of laptop ensembles.}

Can a contrived environment envelope the senses to the point that one feel fully immersed in it? It was with these questions in mind that the interactive mechanical sound art installation endo/exo came into being. Through the use of networked technology the system becomes more like a self-aware organism, passing messages from node to node as cells communicate through chemical signals with their neighbors. In an artistic context, the communication network resembles, but differs from, other mechanical systems. Issues such as latency are often considered negative factors, yet they can contribute a touch of personality in this context. This paper is a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization, as well as playful interaction, creates an ``aliveness'' in the mechanism, and renders its exploration pleasurable, intriguing and uncanny.}

The system combines a multichannel audio feed from the guitar (which is parsed for its pitch, spectral content and note inter--onset time data to provide abstractions of sounded performance gestures) with motion tracking of the performer's larger--scale bodily movements using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect sensor. These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied structural relationships in electroacoustic music outlined in Smalley's theory of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds to control the spatialization of outputs and other textural processes. The paper aims to advance a broadly-applicable 'performance gesture ecology', providing a shared spatial-relational mapping (a 'basic gestural space') which allows for creative (but still coherent) mappings from the performance gestures to the control of textural and spatial structures.}

This project contributes a new open source library, which was developed to allow ESNs to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored, focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control, explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. \emph{Un-trained} behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input. Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use of ESNs in computer music scenarios.}

Notes are played by touch, but are sustained through continuous movement. Pitch bends can be achieved by passing through the space between the notes. Its current implementation runs only on Apple iPad tablet computers using a libPd to convert user interaction into audio. An iPad overlay offers physical feedback for the circles as well as the pitch bend area between the circles. A performable version of the application has been built, though several active developments allow alternative sonic interpretation of the gestures, enhanced visual response to user interaction, and the ability to control the instrument with multiple devices.}

In the first version, Circle Squared, the interface is an array of pressure sensors, and the performer performs on the system without participating directly, like a puppet master. In the second version, control parameters are derived directly from playing on the same piano that performs the output of the system. Here, the performer both plays with and on the system in an intricate dance with the unpredictable output of the unstable virtual ensemble. The underlying mapping strategies are presented, together with the structure of the generative system. Experiences from a series of performances are discussed, primarily from the perspective of the improvising musician.}

Yet motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To this end, a study of listeners' perception of liveness and performer control in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.}

  abstract = {One problem with live computer music performance is the transport of computers to a venue and the following setup of the computers used in playing and rendering music. The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there's a catch, the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud. The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering, or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light and perform live with more computers than ever before.}

As we will discuss, this extended computational matter-centric view is of benefit towards holistically understanding an ``instrument'' gestural engagement, as it is realized through physical material, sonic gestural matter and felt human engagement. We present instrumental systems that have arisen as a result of this approach to instrument design.}

The siren organ can produce a large range of sounds both timbrally and dynamically. In addition to a siren timbre, the instrument produces similar sounds to a harmonica. Portability, robustness, and electronic stability are all areas for improvement.}

Auraglyph offers a number of fundamental audio processing and control operators, as well as facilities for structured input and output. All of these software objects are created, parameterized, and interconnected via stylus and touch input. Underlying this application is an advanced handwriting recognition framework, LipiTk, which can be trained to recognize both alphanumeric characters and arbitrary figures, shapes, and patterns.}

The fundamental human constraints and processes that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes. The control of the musical instrument is less direct than if it were played with muscles that can be controlled in a more direct manner, such as the muscles in the hands.}

Scenes that make it possible for the user to select, explore and recreate different ``sound worlds'' with the tangible interface as an instrument; create and play with it as a friend; improvise and create; or relax with it as an ambient sounding furniture. We continue discussing a user story, how the Scenes are recreated by amateur users, persons with severe disabilities and family members; improvising with the mobile tangibles. We discuss composition techniques for mixing sound, tangible-physical and lighting elements in the Scenes. Based on observations we explore how a diverse audience in the family and at school can recreate and improvise their own sound experience and play together with others. We conclude by discussing the possible impact of our findings for the NIME-community; how the techniques of decomposing, recomposing and recreating sound, based on a relational perspective, could contribute to the design of new instruments for musical expression.}

An open-source software MIDI remapper called ChordEase was developed that dynamically alters the pitch of notes, in order to fit them to the chord scales of a predetermined song. ChordEase modifies the behavior of ordinary MIDI instruments, giving them new interfaces that permit non-modal music to be approached as if it were modal. Multiple instruments can be remapped simultaneously, using a variety of mapping functions, each optimized for a particular musical role. Harmonization and orchestration can also be automated. By facilitating the selection of scale tones, ChordEase enables performers to focus on other aspects of improvisation, and thus creates new possibilities for musical expression.}

Our system searches for a portion of the registered lyrics whose vowel sequence matches the current user input using the probabilistic model, and sends the matched lyrics to the singing voice synthesizer. The vowel input keys are mapped onto a standard musical keyboard, enabling experienced keyboard players to learn the system from a standard musical score.

  abstract = {The Modular Electro-Acoustic Robotic Instrument System (MEARIS) represents a new type of hybrid electroacoustic-electromechanical instrument model. Monochord-Aerophone Robotic Instrument Ensemble (MARIE), the first realization of a MEARIS, is a set of interconnected monochord and cylindrical aerophone robotic musical instruments created by Expressive Machines Musical Instruments (EMMI). MARIE comprises one or more matched pairs of Automatic Monochord Instruments (AMI) and Cylindrical Aerophone Robotic Instruments (CARI). Each AMI and CARI is a self-contained, independently operable robotic instrument with an acoustic element, a control system that enables automated manipulation of this element, and an audio system that includes input and output transducers coupled to the acoustic element. Each AMI-CARI pair can also operate as an interconnected hybrid instrument, allowing for effects that have heretofore been the domain of physical modeling technologies, such as a plucked air column or blown string. Since its creation, MARIE has toured widely, performed with dozens of human instrumentalists, and has been utilized by nine composers in the realization of more than twenty new musical works.}

Over the last year we been developing a hardware and software toolkit for music called modular-muse. Here we describe the design and goals for these tools and how they have been used in different settings to introduce children to concepts of interaction design for music and sound design. Two exploratory studies which used modular-muse are described here with different approaches; a two day build your own instrument workshop where participants learned how to use both hardware and software concurrently to control synthesized sounds and trigger solenoids, and a middle school music classroom where the focus was only on programming for sound synthesis using the modular-muse Pd library. During the second study, a project called Pd Poems, a teaching progression emerged we call Build-Play-Share-Focus which is also described. }

Based ultimately on prime number relationships, harmonic space in Just Intonation is inherently multidimensional, with each prime number tracing a unique path in space. Taking this multidimensionality as its point of departure, the Tuning Vine interface assigns a unique angle and colour to each prime number, along with aligning melodic pitch height to vertical height on the computer screen. These features allow direct and intuitive interaction with Just Intonation. The inclusion of a transposition function along each prime number axis also enables potentially unlimited exploration of harmonic space within prime limit 23. Currently available as desktop software, a prototype for a hardware version has also been constructed, and future tablet app and hardware versions of the Tuning Vine are planned that will allow tangible as well as audiovisual interaction with microtonal harmonic space.}

While auditory or haptic biofeedback may be used in these cases, the additional sensory channels can increase workload or act as a nuisance to the user. A number of studies, however, have shown that music can improve mood and concentration, while also reduce aggression and boredom. Here, we propose an intervention that combines the benefits of biofeedback and music to help users regulate their stress response while performing a visual task (driving a car simulator). Our approach encourages slow breathing by adjusting the quality of the music in response to the user's breathing rate. We evaluate the intervention on a 2$\times$2 design with music and auditory biofeedback as independent variables. Our results indicate that our music-biofeedback intervention leads to lower arousal (reduced electrodermal activity and increased heart rate variability) than music alone, auditory biofeedback alone and a control condition. }

Inspired by the Tonnetz (a tonal diagram), we present a new layout of pitches defined using low-level harmonic notions. We demonstrate the potential of our system by mapping the random movements of fish in an aquarium to this layout. Qualitatively, we find that this captures the intuition behind mapping motion to sound. Similarly moving fish produce consonant chords, while fish moving in non-unison produce dissonant chords. We introduce an open source MATLAB library implementing these techniques, which can be used for sonifying multimodal streaming data. }

Most of these arrange notes in chromatic half-steps along the horizontal axis and in intervals of fourths along the vertical axis. Although many alternatives exist, this arrangement, which resembles that of a bass guitar, is quickly becoming the de facto standard. In this study we present experimental evidence that grid based instruments are significantly easier to play when we tune adjacent rows in Major thirds rather than fourths. We have developed a grid-based instrument as an iPad app that has sold 8,000 units since 2012. To test our proposed alternative tuning, we taught a group twenty new users to play basic chords on our app, using both the standard tuning and our proposed alternative. Our results show that the Major thirds tuning is much easier to learn, even for users that have previous experience playing guitar.}

Additionally, it is difficult to visualize similarities and differences between all samples of a song simultaneously and use this to select samples. MusicMapper is a web application that allows nonexpert users to find and visualize distinctive samples from a song without any manual intervention, and enables remixing by having users play back clusterings of such samples. This is accomplished by splitting audio from the Soundcloud API into appropriately-sized spectrograms, and applying the t-SNE algorithm to visualize these spectrograms in two dimensions. Next, we apply k-means to guide the user's eye toward related clusters and set $k=26$ to enable playback of the clusters by pressing keys on an ordinary keyboard. We present the source code (https://github.com/fatsmcgee/MusicMappr) and a demo video (http://youtu.be/mvD6e1uiO8k) of the MusicMapper web application that can be run in most modern browsers.}

  abstract = {Based on a combination of novel mapping techniques and carefully designed sound engines, I present an augmented hybrid piano specifically designed for improvisation. The mapping technique, originally developed for other control interfaces but here adapted to the piano keyboard, is based on a dynamic vectorization of control parameters, allowing both wild sonic exploration and minute intimate expression. The original piano sound is used as the sole sound source, subjected to processing techniques such as virtual resonance strings, dynamic buffer shuffling, and acoustic and virtual feedback. Thanks to speaker and microphone placement, the acoustic and processed sounds interact in both directions and blend into one new instrument. This also allows for unorthodox playing (knocking, plucking, shouting). Processing parameters are controlled from the keyboard playing alone, allowing intuitive control of complex processing by ear, integrating expressive musical playing with sonic exploration. The instrument is not random, but somewhat unpredictable. This feeds into the improvisation, defining a particular idiomatics of the instruments. Hence, the instrument itself is an essential part of the musical work. Performances include concerts in UK, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Sweden, in solos and ensembles, performed by several pianists. Variations of this hybrid instrument for digital keyboards are also presented.}

It relies on spectators and performers revealing virtual objects by slicing through them with body parts or objects, and on planar slightly reflective transparent panels that combine the stage and audience spaces. In this paper, we describe the approach and implementation challenges of Reflets. We then demonstrate that it matches the requirements of musical performances. It allows for placing virtual content anywhere on large stages, even overlapping with physical elements and provides a consistent rendering of this content for large numbers of spectators. It also preserves non-verbal communication between the audience and the performers, and is inherently engaging for the spectators. We finally show that Reflets opens musical performance opportunities such as augmented interaction between musicians and novel techniques for 3D sound shapes manipulation.}

It is argued that the system promotes the sensation of liveness through clear, perceptible links between the performer's gestures, the system's audio outputs and the its visual outputs. The system also provides a novel approach to the use of generative techniques in the composition and live performance of songs. Future developments would include the use of dynamic text effects linked to sound generation and greater interaction between human performer and the visuals. }

The hardware is designed to be robust and quickly reproducible (parametric design and machine fabrication), while the software aims to be light-weight (low-CPU requirements) and portable (multiple platforms, multiple computing architectures). Above all, the instrument aims for the level of control intimacy and tactile expressivity achieved by traditional acoustic percussive instruments, while leveraging real-time software synthesis and control to expand the sonic palette.

One particular challenge is that humans easily follow scores and chord charts, adapt these to new performance plans, and understand media locations in musical terms (beats and measures), while computer music systems often use rigid and even numerical representations that are difficult to work with. We present new formalisms and representations, and a corresponding implementation, where musical material in various media is synchronized, where musicians can quickly alter the performance order by specifying (re-)arrangements of the material, and where interfaces are supported in a natural way by music notation.}

In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist, learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size, and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.}

In both cases, the design process is not focused on creating DMIs for a community with a particular culture --- with established instruments, repertoire and playing styles --- outside European and North American traditions. This challenge motivated our research. In this paper, we discuss lessons learned during an one-year project called Batebit.

Great care has been taken in the technical design to ensure that the resulting work is scalable both in numbers of elements and in physical dimensions.

For instance, how does one compose for a non-linear, indeterminate experience using linear pre-composed placed sounds, where fixed musical time is situated into the indeterminate time of the user's experience? Furthermore, how does one create a soundtrack that is suitable for the location, but also functions as a coherent musical structure? We explore these questions by analyzing an existing `placed sound' work from a traditional music theory perspective and in doing so reveal some structural principals from `fixed' musical forms can also support the composition of contemporary locative music experiences.}

  abstract = {Twitter has provided a social platform for everyone to enter the previously exclusive world of the internet, enriching this online social tapestry with cultural diversity and enabling revolutions. We believe this same tool can be used to also change the world of music creation. Thus we present MMODM, an online drum machine based on the Twitter streaming API, using tweets from around the world to create and perform musical sequences together in real time. Users anywhere can express 16-beat note sequences across 26 different instruments using plain text tweets on their favorite device, in real-time. Meanwhile, users on the site itself can use the graphical interface to locally DJ the rhythm, filters, and sequence blending. By harnessing this duo of website and Twitter network, MMODM enables a whole new scale of synchronous musical collaboration between users locally, remotely, across a wide variety of computing devices, and across a variety of cultures.}

This paper marks the start of a project investigating acousmatic spatial imagery, real gestural behaviour and ultimately the formation of tangible acousmatic images. These concepts are explored experimentally using motion tracking in a source-sound recording context, interactive parameter-mapping sonification in three-dimensional high-order ambisonics, composition and performance. The spatio-musical role of physical actions in relation to instrument excitation is used as a point of departure for embodying physical spatial gestures in the creative process. The work draws on how imagery for music is closely linked with imagery for music-related actions.}

In order to do so, flexible algorithms were designed with the capacity of working even with an imprecise placement of the sensors. This makes it easy and accessible for all potential users. At least 4 sensors are required: 2 for the front and 2 for the back; this prototype uses 6. The sensors are rather inexpensive, widening the economic availability. For each individual musician, the algorithms are capable of ``personalising'' postures in order to create consistent evaluations; the results of which may be, but are not limited to: new musical interfaces, educational analysis of technique, or music controllers. In building a prototype for the algorithms, data was acquired by wiring the sensors to a data-logger. The algorithms and tests were implemented using MATLAB. After designing the algorithms, various tests were run in order to prove their reliability. These determined that indeed the algorithms work to a sufficient degree of certainty, allowing for a reliable classification of a musician's posture or position.}

It has become commonplace to stream music and video of musical performance over the web. However, the goal of playing rhythmically synchronized music over long distances has remained elusive due to the latency inherent in networked communication. The farther apart two artists are from one another, the greater the delay. Furthermore, latency times can change abruptly with no warning. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a distributed, synchronized musical instrument that allows performers to play together over long distances, despite latency. We describe one such instrument, MalLo, which combats latency by predicting a musician's action before it is completed. MalLo sends information about a predicted musical note over the Internet before it is played, and synthesizes this note at a collaborator's location at nearly the same moment it is played by the performer. MalLo also protects against latency spikes by sending the prediction data across multiple network paths, with the intention of routing around latency. }

This suggests that musical worlds coevolve with their agents through repeated sensorimotor interactions with the environment (where the music is being created), and at the same time cannot be separated from their sociocultural contexts. This paper investigates this claim by exploring ways in which technology, physiology, and context are bound up within two different musical scenarios: live electronic musical performance; and person-centred arts applications of NIMEs. In this paper I outline an ethnographic and phenomenological enquiry into my experiences as both a performer of live electronic and electro-instrumental music, as well as my extensive background in working with new technologies in various therapeutic and person-centred artistic situations. This is in order to explore the sociocultural and technological contexts in which these activities take place. I propose that by understanding creative musical participation as a highly contextualised practice, we may discover that the greatest impact of rapidly developing technological resources is their ability to afford richly diverse, personalised, and embodied forms of music making. I argue that this is applicable over a wide range of musical communities.}

Such systems do not take advantage of higher level semantically meaningful brain data which could be used in adaptive systems or without detracting from the attention of the user. We present a new type of real-time BCI that assists users in musical improvisation by adapting to users' measured cognitive workload implicitly. Our system advances the state of the art in this area in three ways: 1) We demonstrate that cognitive workload can be classified in real-time while users play the piano using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. 2) We build a real-time, implicit system using this brain signal that musically adapts to what users are playing. 3) We demonstrate that users prefer this novel musical instrument over other conditions and report that they feel more creative.}

Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.}

Inclusive music processes employ consumer controllers, computer access tools and/or specialized digital musical instruments (DMIs). The first category reveals a design ethos identified by the authors as artefact multiplication -- many sliders, buttons, dials and menu layers; the latter types offer ergonomic accessibility through artefact magnification. We present a prototype DMI that eschews artefact multiplication in pursuit of enhanced real time creative independence. We reconceptualise the universal click-drag interaction model via a single sensor type, which affords both binary and continuous performance control. Accessibility is optimized via a familiar interaction model and through customized ergonomics, but it is the mapping strategy that emphasizes transparency and sophistication in the hierarchical correspondences between the available gesture dimensions and expressive musical cues. Through a participatory and progressive methodology we identify an ostensibly simple targeting gesture rich in dynamic and reliable features: (1) contact location; (2) contact duration; (3) momentary force; (4) continuous force, and; (5) dyad orientation. These features are mapped onto dynamic musical cues, most notably via new mappings for vibrato and arpeggio execution. }

Even when the relationship between action and sound is readily understandable, the internal hardware or software operations that create that relationship may be inaccessible to scrutiny or modification. This paper presents a new approach to digital instrument design which lets the performer alter and subvert the instrument's internal operation through circuit-bending techniques. The approach uses low-latency feedback loops between software and analog hardware to expose the internal working of the instrument. Compared to the standard control voltage approach used on analog synths, alterations to the feedback loops produce distinctive and less predictable changes in behaviour with original artistic applications. This paper discusses the technical foundations of the approach, its roots in hacking and circuit bending, and case studies of its use in live performance with the D-Box hackable instrument.}

These control dimensions are mapped onto a modified HandSketch sound engine that achieves multitimbral pitch-synchronous point cloud granulation.}

  abstract = {We explore how to digitally augment musical instruments by connecting them to their social histories. We describe the use of Internet of Things technologies to connect an acoustic guitar to its digital footprint -- a record of how it was designed, built and played. We introduce the approach of crafting interactive decorative inlay into the body of an instrument that can then be scanned using mobile devices to reveal its digital footprint. We describe the design and construction of an augmented acoustic guitar called Carolan alongside activities to build its digital footprint through documented encounters with twenty-seven players in a variety of settings. We reveal the design challenge of mapping the different surfaces of the instrument to various facets of its footprint so as to afford appropriate experiences to players, audiences and technicians. We articulate an agenda for further research on the topic of connecting instruments to their social histories, including capturing and performing digital footprints and creating personalized and legacy experiences.}

Emphasizing its close relationship and potential future use in new digital musical instruments (DMI) practice and reviewing literature, this paper will introduce fundamental concepts about motor imagery (MI), various methods of measuring MI in different configurations and summarize some important findings about MI in various studies. Following, it will discuss how this research area is related to DMI practice and propose potential uses of MI in this field. }

Based on given sound samples, the participants have to identify the right musical instrument (harpsichord, double bass, viola) out of an instrument collection. As the right instrument is located, a challenge of playing an application on the tablet is initiated. This application is an interactive digital representation of the found instrument, mimicking some of its key playing techniques, using a simplified scrolling on screen musical notation. The musical performance of the participant is graded on a point scale. After completion of the challenge, the participants' performances of the three instruments are played back simultaneously, constituting a composition. A qualitative evaluation of the application in a focus group interview with school children revealed that the children were more engaged when playing with the interactive application than when only watching a music video.}

This paper describes the basic principles of Real World Audio (RWA), an extendable audio game engine for targeting smartphone operating systems, which rolls out all functionality for the generation of the above-mentioned software genres. It combines the ability for building location-based audio walks and -guides with the components necessary for game development. Using either the smartphone sensors or an external sensor board for head tracking and gesture recognition, RWA allows developers to create audio walks, audio adventures and audio role playing games (RPG) outside in the real world.}

Using co-reflection with four musical therapists and literature research, design guidelines related to this specific user-group and context are formed. This leads to a concept of which the most relevant aspects are discussed, before describing the user studies. Finally, the plan for the redesign is discussed. The WamBam has unique possibilities to deal with the low motor skills and cognitive abilities of severely intellectually disabled users while music therapists benefit from the greater versatility and portability of this design compared to other musical instruments. A prototype was tested with twenty users. Participants proved to be triggered positively by the WamBam, but three limiting usability issues were found. These issues were used as the fundamentals for a second prototype. Music therapists confirm the value of the WamBam for their practice. }

  abstract = {Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians influence the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality. More specifically, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We suggest that the perceived causality between a performer's gestures and the musical result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of an experimental study investigating the effect of visual augmentations on audience's inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of performances with DMIs impacts the audience's causal inferences about the performer. In particular we show that visual augmentations help highlight the influence of the musician when parts of the music are automated, and help clarify complex mappings between gestures and sounds. Finally we discuss the potential wider implications for assessing liveness in the design of new musical interfaces.}

The haptic hand is distinguished from other haptic keyboards in the sense that each finger is meant to stay with a particular key. The haptic hand promotes unencumbered interaction with the keys. The user can easily position a finger over a key and press downward to activate it---the user does not need to insert his or her fingers into an unwieldy exoskeleton or set of thimbles.

The system functions by sampling a performers input, processing or reshaping this sampled input, and then repeatedly replaying it. The degree to which the sampled control signal is processed during replay is adjustable in real-time by the manipulation of a continuous finger slider function. The reshaping algorithm uses stochastic methods commonly used for MIDI note generation from a provided dataset. The reshaped signal therefore varies in an unpredictable manner. In this way the Gestroviser is a device to capture, reshape and replay an instrumental gesture. We describe the result of initial user testing of the system and discuss possible further development.}

Even worse, they are not easy to be revised. Most importantly, there should be more amusing and engaging interaction between a tuning trainer and a user which is able to exchange roles of tuner and player. In this research, we implement an open-source program named ``Harmonic Intonation Trainer'' in Pure Data. It includes most of essential elements of a smart tuner. A user can tune his pitch while optionally hearing (through earphones) the target pitch and other harmonic intervals in respective octaves. Moreover, in its interactive accompanist mode, a user's input pitch serves as the reference frequency; the program follows his intonation to generate corresponding harmonic intervals. Additionally, user can straightforwardly edit all parameters and patches by Pure Data. Any adoption or revision is absolutely welcome. Finally, we will initiate another research to test and to inspect experimental results from student orchestras so that its future version is expected to be more sophisticated.}

We then discuss mapping the Pearl both to generate sound and control its interactive lighting, and identify different strategies for its use.

The use of embodied metaphors within these mappings is seen as a means of managing the complexity of a musical performance across multiple modalities. In particular, we will investigate how these mapping strategies may facilitate the creation of performance systems whose accessibility and richness are enhanced by common integrating bases. A key focus for this work is the investigation of the embodied image schema theories of Lakoff and Johnson alongside similarly embodied metaphorical models within Smalley's influential theory of electroacoustic music (spectromorphology). These metaphors will be investigated for their use as grounding structural components and dynamics for creative practices and musical interaction design. We argue that pairing metaphorical models of forces with environmental forms may have particular significance for the design of complex mappings for digital music performance.}

  abstract = {This paper examines the notion of community as commonly employed within NIME discourses. Our aim is to clarify and define the term through the community of practice framework. We argue that through its formal use and application, the notion of community becomes a significant space for the examination of emergent musical practices that could otherwise be overlooked. This paper defines community of practice, as originally developed in the social sciences by Lave and Wegener, and applies it within the NIME context through the examination of existing communities of practice such as the laptop performance community, laptop orchestras, as well as the Satellite CCRMA and Patchblocks communities. }

In particular we examine the potential of source code both to display the state of running processes and also to alter state using means other than traditional text editing. In contrast to previous research that has focused on the inclusion of additional interactive widgets inside or alongside text editors, our research adds a parsing stage to the runtime evaluation of code fragments and imparts additional interactive capabilities on the source code itself. After implementing various techniques in the creative coding environment Gibber, we evaluate our research through a survey on the various methods of visual feedback provided by our research. In addition to results quantifying preferences for certain techniques over others, we found near unanimous support among survey respondents for including similar techniques in other live coding environments.}

To achieve the gesture localization we use a novel approach combining attack parametrization and template matching across the two microphone channels. With this method we can correctly localize 80 $\pm$ 9 % of the percussive gestures. The user can assign determined pitches to specific positions and change the pitch palette in real time. The tactile feedback characteristic of every surface opens a set of new playing strategies and possibilities specific to any chosen object. The advantages of such a system are the affordable production, flexibility of concert location, object-specific musical instruments, portability, and easy setup.}

  abstract = {This study compares the stage metaphor and the channel strip metaphor in terms of performance. Traditionally, music mixing consoles employ a channels strip control metaphor for adjusting parameters such as volume and panning of each track. An alternative control metaphor, the so-called stage metaphor lets the user adjust volume and panning by positioning tracks relative to a virtual listening position. In this study test participants are given the task to adjust volume and panning of one channel (in mixes consisting of three channels) in order to replicate a series of simple pre-rendered mixes. They do this using (1) a small physical mixing controller and (2) using an iPad app, which implements a simple stage metaphor interface. We measure how accurately they are able to replicate mixes in terms of volume and panning and how fast they are at doing so. Results reveal that performance is surprisingly similar and thus we are not able to detect any significant difference in performance between the two interfaces. Qualitative data however, suggests that the stage metaphor is largely favoured for its intuitive interaction --- confirming earlier studies. }

We used scientific research as a starting point to create a means of sound production and resonator, using a 3D model obtained from Computed Topology (CT) scans of a Corythosaurus skull and an endocast of its crest and nasal passages. Users give voice to the dinosaur by blowing into a mouthpiece, exciting a larynx mechanism and resonating the sound through the hadrosaur's full-scale nasal cavities and skull. This action allows an embodied glimpse into an ancient past. Users know the dinosaur through the controlled exhalation of their breath, how the compression of the lungs leads to a whisper or a roar.}

Inherent subjectivity in these assessments is inevitable, yet the recognition of performance attributes by which humans perceive quality has wide applicability to related tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR) community and jazz pedagogy. Preliminary results indicate that several musiciologically-informed features of relatively low computational complexity perform reasonably well in predicting performance quality labels via ordinary least squares regression.}

Thus, in the case of the Wave Duet, the produced buoys were prompted by investigating the relationship between sonic objects and natural phenomena. As a result, the mappings, physical and sound designs directly reflect these issues. Finally, it is also suggested that during the course of development, unintended issues may emerge and further inform how the work is perceived in a broader sense. }

class profiles. This data triggers the generation of objects in a virtual world
based on the `topography' of the source sound, which is experienced
by network clients via Google Cardboard headsets. They use their movements to
trigger audio in various microtonal tunings and incidentally generate scores.
These scores are transmitted to performers who improvise music from this notation
using Leap Motion Theremins, also in VR space. Finally, the performance is
broadcast via a web audio stream, which can be heard by the composer-audience in
the initial virtual world. The `real-time composers' and performers
are not required to have any prior knowledge of complex computer systems and
interact either using head position tracking, or with a Oculus Rift DK2 and a
Leap Motion Camera. }

  abstract = {This demonstration describes Tango, software for
Computer-Human Improvisation developed for more than 25 years by Henning Berg.
Tango listens to an improvising musician, analyses what it hears
and plays musical responses which relate directly to the musical input.
If the improviser in turn reacts to these answers, a musical loop between the
human and the machine can emerge. The way input and reaction correlate and the
predictability of Tango's responses can be defined by the user via a setup
of improvising environments, called Rooms.
Real-time sampling with knowledge of the musical content behind the samples and
Midi-handling are unified via Tango's own monophonic audio-to-Midi, time
stretching and pitch shifting algorithms. Both audio and Midi can be used by
Tango's modules (e.g. Listeners, Players, Modifiers, Metronomes or Harmony)
for input and output.
A flexible real time control system allows for internal and external remote
control and scaling of most parameters.

musical instruments and other tangible interfaces perform in terms of latency
from user action to sound output? This paper examines several common
configurations where a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino) or wireless device

generally-accepted guidelines for latency and jitter. To address this limitation,
the paper presents a new embedded platform, Bela, which is capable of complex

such as smart-phones) will have system clocks that are synchronized to a high
degree (less than 1 ms of error). This will enable us to coordinate events across
unconnected devices with a degree of accuracy that was previously impossible. In
particular, high clock synchronization means that we can use these clocks to
synchronize tempo between humans or sequencers with little-to-no communication
between the devices. To facilitate this low-overhead tempo synchronization, we
propose the Global Metronome, which is a simple, computationally cheap method to
obtain absolute tempo synchronization. We present experimental results
demonstrating the effectiveness of using the Global Metronome and compare the
performance to MIDI clock sync, a common synchronization method. Finally, we
present an open source implementation of a Global Metronome server using a
GPS-connected Raspberry Pi that can be built for under $100.}

infinite resolution of analogue circuits.}

the future, we need to reconcile the performance of historical and new stereo
works, side-by-side native 3-D compositions. In anticipation of this growing
need, we have designed and tested a prototype `Virtualmonium'. The
Virtualmonium is an instrument for classical diffusion performance over an
acousmonium emulated in higher-order Ambisonics. It allows composers to
custom-design loudspeaker orchestra emulations for the performance of their
works, rehearse and refine performances off-site, and perform classical
repertoire alongside native 3-D formats in the same concert. This paper describes
the technical design of the Virtualmonium, assesses the success of the prototype
in some preliminary listening tests and concerts, and speculates how the
instrument can further composition and performance practice.}

integrates the sensor inside a synthetic reed, respectively between layers of

Sensor reeds open up new possibilities to pick up woodwind instruments and to

beginning of the consumer video game era. In particular the chiptune genre of
music uses sounds from 8-bit video games; these sounds have even found their way
into contemporary popular music. However, in this genre, game sounds are arranged
using conventional musical interfaces, meaning the games themselves (their
algorithms, design and interactivity) play no role in the creation of the music.
This paper describes a new way of creating music with 8-bit games, by reverse
engineering and augmenting them with run-time scripts. A new API, Emstrument, is
presented which allows these scripts to send MIDI to music production software.
The end result is game-derived musical interfaces any computer musician can use
with their existing workflow. This enhances prior work in repurposing games as
musical interfaces by allowing musicians to use the original games instead of
having to build new versions with added musical capabilities.
Several examples of both new musical instruments and dynamic interactive musical
compositions using Emstrument are presented, using iconic games from the 8-bit
era.}

This environment is composed of 3 modules: a MIDI player, a music animation and a haptic module that translates the notes played by one instrument into a resemblant vibration. To create the haptic vibration, the notes' relative pitch in the song are calculated, then these positions are mapped into the haptic signals' amplitude and frequency. Also, the envelope of the haptic signal is modified, by using an ADSR filter, to have the same envelope as the audio signal. To evaluate the perceived cross-modal similarity between users, two experiments were performed. In both, the users used the complete entertainment environment to rank the similarity between 3 different haptic signals, with triangular, square and analogue envelopes and 4 different instruments in a classical song. The first experiment was performed with the purposed amplitude and frequency technique, while the second experiment was performed with constant frequency and amplitude. Results, show different envelope user preferences. The square and triangular envelopes were preferred in the first experiment, while only analogue envelopes were preferred in the second. This suggests that the users' envelope perception was masked by the changes in amplitude and frequency.}

  abstract = {Most instruments traditionally used to teach music in early
education, like xylophones or flutes, encumber children with the additional
difficulty of an unfamiliar and unnatural interface. The most simple expressive
interaction, that even the smallest children use in order to make music, is
pounding at surfaces. Through the design of an instrument with a simple
interface, like a drum, but which produces a melodic sound, children can be
provided with an easy and intuitive means to produce consonance. This should then
be further complemented with information from analysis and interpretation of
childlike gestures and dance moves, reflecting their natural understanding
of musical structure and motion. Based on these assumptions we propose a modular
and reactive system for dynamic composition with accessible interfaces, divided
into distinct plugins usable in a standard digital audio workstation. This paper
describes our concept and how it can facilitate access to collaborative music
making for small children. A first prototypical implementation has been
designed and developed during the ongoing research project
Drum-Dance-Music-Machine (DDMM), a cooperation with the local social welfare
association AWO Hagen and the chair of musical education at the University of
Applied Sciences Bielefeld.}

consisting of mechanisms designed to enable musical expressivity and minimise

emitted to allow StrumBot to play in intimate venues such as caf\'{e}s or
restaurants without loud motor noises detracting from the musical experience.
StrumBot improves upon previous RMI's by allowing additional expressive
opportunities for a composer to utilise. StrumBot can perform slides, vibrato,
muting techniques, pitch bends, pluck power variances, timbre control, complex
chords and fast strumming patterns.
A MIDI input allows commercial or custom controllers to operate StrumBot. Novel
note allocation algorithms were created to allow a single MIDI stream of notes to
be allocated across the six guitar strings.
Latency measurements from MIDI input to string pluck are as low as 40 ms for a
best case scenario strum, allowing StrumBot to accompany a live musician with
minimal audible delay.
A relay based loop switcher is incorporated, allowing StrumBot to activate
standard commercial guitar pedals based on a MIDI instruction. }

musically rich and expressive because each door has specific sound
characteristics and each person makes it sound slightly different. By augmenting
the door to create an unexpected sound, this project encourages us to listen to
our daily lives with a musician's critical ear, and reminds us of the musicality

improve the performing artist's musical and performative expressions. New
ways of performing music with a clarinet also opens up for novel ways of
composing musical pieces. The design is iterated in two versions with improved
hardware and form factor where everything is packaged into the clarinet bell. The
clarinet uses electronics that wirelessly sends sensor data to a computer that
processes a live audio feed via the software MAX 7 and plays it back via
loudspeakers on the stage. The extended clarinet provides several ways of
transforming audio and also adds several ways of making performances more
visually interesting. It is shown that this way of using sensor technology in a
traditional musical instrument adds new dimensions to the performance and allows
creative persons to express themselves in new ways as well as giving the audience
an improved experience. }

aspects of the performance that influenced their tension judgments. We analysed
the data to explore how auditory and visual components and the performer's

audience's enjoyment and interest in the performance; and second, given the same
DMI and same performer, whether playing in a conventional (vernacular) versus an
experimental musical style affects an audience's response. We held a concert in
which two DMI creator-performers each played two pieces in differing styles.
Before the concert, each half the 64-person audience was given a technical
explanation of one of the instruments. Results showed that receiving an
explanation increased the reported understanding of that instrument, but had no
effect on either the reported level of interest or enjoyment. On the other hand,
performances in experimental versus conventional style on the same instrument
received widely divergent audience responses. We discuss implications of these
findings for DMI design.}

each song: one desynchronized, and one with the mapping inverted. Participants
viewed all six songs with either the original or desynchronized soundtrack
(Experiment 1), or either the original or inverted-mapping soundtrack (Experiment
2). Participants were asked several questions via questionnaire after each song.
Overall, they reported higher engagement and preference for the original
versions, suggesting that audiences of the TSPW prefer more highly synchronized
performances, as well as more intuitive mappings, though level of perceived
expression of the performer only significantly differed in Experiment 1. Further,
we believe that our experimental methods contribute to how DMIs can be evaluated

We describe two live writing performances that take different approaches as they vary the degree of composition and improvisation in writing.}

today are based on location-oriented striking techniques, resulting in a finger
drumming interaction paradigm, that is both fundamentally eclectic as well as
imposingly contr. The few controllers that allow hand-drumming
techniques also invariably conform to region-based triggering design, or, in
trade-off for expressivity, end up excluding hardware connectivity options that
are vital to the context of the modern electronic rhythm producer. The HandSolo
is a timbre-based drum controller that allows the use of natural, hand-drumming
strokes, whilst offering the same end-goal functionality that percussion
controller users have come to expect over the past decade.}

keyboard to capture velocity and other continuous musical properties, in order to
support more expressive interaction with music software. Building on existing
`virtual piano' utilities, the device is designed to provide a richer
mechanism for note entry within predominantly non-realtime editing tasks, in
applications where keyboard interaction is a central component of the user
experience (score editors, sequencers, DAWs, trackers, live coding), and in which
users draw on virtuosities in both music and computing.
In the keyboard, additional hardware combines existing scan code (key press)
data with accelerometer readings to create a secondary USB device, using the same
cable but visible to software as a separate USB MIDI device aside existing USB
HID functionality. This paper presents and evaluates an initial prototype,
developed using an Arduino board and inexpensive sensors, and discusses design
considerations and test findings in musical applications, drawing on user studies
of keyboard-mediated music interaction. Without challenging more established (and
expensive) performance devices; significant benefits are demonstrated in
notation-mediated interaction, where the user's focus rests with
software.}

of two types of flutes, the recorder and transverse flute, with interchangeable
mouthpieces. These flutes are designed to play subharmonic microtonal scales. The
discussion provides an overview of the design and implementation process,
including calculation methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing
technologies, as well as an evaluation of some of the difficulties encountered.
Results from our 3D printed flutes suggest that whilst further refinements are
necessary in our designs, 3D modelling and printing techniques offer new and
valuable methods for the design and production of customised musical instruments.
The long term goal of this project is to create a system in which users can
specify the tuning of their instrument to generate a 3D model and have it printed

by the Gesture Variation Follower, which is initially designed and developed at
IRCAM in Paris and then extended at Goldsmiths College in London. x2Gesture
supports both learning of musical gestures and live performing, through gesture
sonification, as a unified user experience. The deeper understanding of the
expressive gestural variations permits to define the confidence bounds of the
expert's gestures, which are used during the decoding phase of the
recognition. The first experiments show promising results in terms of recognition
accuracy and temporal alignment between template and performed gesture, which
leads to a better fluidity and immediacy and thus gesture sonification. }

Suggestions on how deaf and hearing people can collaborate in creating music

general interest in music as well as hearing musicians as target groups. Through
reviewing different related research areas, it is found that visualization of
sound along with a haptic feedback can help deaf people interpret and interact
with music. With this in mind, three variations of a collaborative user interface
are presented, in which deaf and hearing people are meant to collaborate in
creating short beats and melody sequences. Through evaluating the three
prototypes, with two deaf people and two hearing musicians, it is found that the
target groups can collaborate to some extent in creating beats. However, in order
for the target groups to create melodic sequences together in a satisfactory
manner, more detailed visualization and distributed haptic output is necessary,
mostly due to the fact that the deaf test participants struggle in distinguishing
between higher pitch and timbre. }

technologies aimed at enabling basic tasks in everyday life (locomotion, eating,

provide a chance for emotional enjoyment, as well as improve physical conditions

  abstract = {We present an innovative sound spatialization and shaping
interface, called SoundMorpheus, which allows the placement of sounds in space,
as well as the altering of sound characteristics, via arm movements that resemble
those of a conductor. The interface displays sounds (or their attributes) to the
user, who reaches for them with one or both hands, grabs them, and gently or
forcefully sends them around in space, in a 360$^{\circ}$ circle. The system
combines MIDI and traditional instruments with one or more myoelectric sensors.
These components may be physically collocated or distributed in various locales
connected via the Internet. This system also supports the performance of
acousmatic and electronic music, enabling performances where the traditionally
central mixing board, need not be touched at all (or minimally touched for
calibration). Finally, the system may facilitate the recording of a visual score
of a performance, which can be stored for later playback and additional
manipulation. We present three projects that utilize SoundMorpheus and
demonstrate its capabilities and potential.}

lack of disrespectful hackers, known as crackers, in attendance
carrying the appropriate equipment and software necessary to hack a
performance. Yet many modern NIMEs could be hacked from smart-phones
in the audience. The lack of security hardening makes NIMEs an easy
target --- but a question arises: if hacking can interrupt or modify
a performance couldn't hacking itself also be performance? Thus
would music hacking, live-hacking, be similar to live-coding? In
this paper we discuss how NIMEs are in danger of being hacked, and
yet how hacking can be an act of performance too.}

describe in detail what functionality is required to inform an implementation. In
our earlier work we showed that Acoustic Localisation (AL) potentially can
provide a pervasive technique for spatially interactive audio applications.
Playing through the application scenarios with AL in mind provides interesting

mind an approach that is uncommon in augmented instrument design and
seeks to strike a balance between minimal design and robust control. MIGSI uses
sensor technology to capture gestural data such as valve displacement, hand
tension, and instrument position, to offer extended control and expressivity to
trumpet players. Several streams of continuous data are transmitted wirelessly
from MIGSI to the receiving computer, where MIGSI Mapping application (a simple
graphical user interface) parses the incoming data into individually accessible
variables. It is our hope that MIGSI will be adopted by trumpet players and

draw on voices and forces from the natural environment, humans and machines. The

eclectic forms of sensing and interaction. This vision could dramatically impact
computer science education, simultaneously modernizing the field and drawing in
diverse new participants. We describe our work creating a NIME-inspired computer
music toolkit for kids called BlockyTalky; the toolkit enables users to create
networks of sensing devices and synthesizers. We offer findings from our research
on student learning through programming and performance. We conclude by
suggesting a number of future directions for NIME researchers interested in
education.}

  abstract = {This paper describes an instance of what we call `curated research', a concerted thinking, making and performance activity between two research teams with a dedicated interest in the creation of experimental musical instruments and the development of new performance practices. Our work builds theoretically upon critical work in philosophy, anthropology and aesthetics, and practically upon previous explorations of strategies for facilitating rapid, collaborative, publicly-oriented making in artistic settings. We explored an orientation to making which promoted the creation of a family of instruments and performance environments that were responses to the self-consciously provocative theme of `One Knob To Rule Them All'. A variety of design issues were explored including: mapping, physicality, the question of control in interface design, reductionist aesthetics and design strategies, and questions of gender and power in musical culture. We discuss not only the technologies which were made but also reflect on the value of such concerted, provocatively thematised, collective making activities for addressing foundational design issues. As such, our work is intended not just as a technical and practical contribution to NIME but also a reflective provocation into how we conduct research itself in a curated critical manner.}

implemented real-time adaptive features that respond to a detailed monitoring of

We intend this technology to be easy to use and implement by experts and novices alike: We ensure the ease of use by providing a host application that tracks touch points and passes these on as OSC or MIDI messages. We make our design easy to implement by providing open source software and hardware and by choosing evaluation methods that use accessible tools, making quantitative comparisons between different branches of the design easy. We chose to work with textile to take advantage of its tactile properties and its malleability of form and to pay tribute to textile's rich cultural heritage. }

Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate and thereby produce sound.  In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet.  For a beginner, this can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lips position.  This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible and measurable.  The augmented flute shows information about the area covered by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it shows graphically the air jet direction.  Additionally, the augmented flute provides directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced flutists.}

This approach breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to transduce gesture into sonic output.  We outline a method for generating multimodal terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain. We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.}

Two problems are addressed: 1) the sensor cannot detect overlapping hands 2) The sensor's limited detection range. Training examples included 7 kinds of overlapping hand gestures as well as hand trajectories where a hand goes out of the sensor's range. The overlapping gestures were treated as a classification problem and the best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with 62% accuracy. The out-of-range problem was treated first as a clustering problem to group the training examples into a small number of trajectory types, then as a classification problem to predict trajectory type based on the hand's motion before going out of range. The best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with an accuracy of 30%. The prediction models were implemented in an ongoing multimedia electroacoustic vocal performance and an educational project named Embodied Sonic Meditation (ESM).  }

The Review was conducted with demonstrations by groups of students supervised by different Lecturer, in each case focusing on a different strategy to create a connection between Sound, Music, Acoustics, Space and Architectural Design. There was an assumption that the core working process would have to include the design of a new musical instrument, which in some cases became the final deliverable of the Studio and in other cases a step in a process that leads to a different outcome (such as an architectural Design, a performance or social experiment). One other relevant aspect was that Digital technology was used in the design and fabrication of the physical instruments' prototypes, but in very few cases, it was used in the actual generation or enhancement of sound, with the instruments relying almost exclusively in acoustic and mechanical sound.  }

In this study, a model is proposed for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75% mean accuracy.}

Designed in the form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer's muscle movements into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals.  The primary goal in designing Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract for Biostomp can be viewed at vimeo.com/biostomp/video.}

The human skeletal data is acquired through a Microsoft Kinect v2.  The movement of the student is mirrored through an abstract skeletal figure and instructions are provided through a virtual teacher.  Posture deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual feedback modality with no feedback leads to an increase in posture accuracy (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.047). Reaction card feedback and expert interviews indicate that the feedback is considered fun and useful for training independently from the teacher.}

Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support their decisions.  To address this issue, we follow a design rationale approach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new design space. We then use this design space to discuss potential guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool&#8212;called the "Voice Reaping Machine". Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works in the literature.}

However, publications of novel interfaces often lack the required detail due to the complexity or the focus on a specific part of the interfaces and absence of a specific template or structure to describe these interactions. Drawing on and synthesizing models from interaction design and music making we propose a way for modeling musical interfaces by providing a scheme and visual language to describe, design, analyze, and compare interfaces for music making. To illustrate its capabilities we apply the proposed model to a range of assistive musical instruments, which often draw on multi-modal in- and output, resulting in complex designs and descriptions thereof.}

An important innovation is the ability to learn how the improvised accompaniment should respond to variations in the melody performance, using tempo and embellishment complexity as features, resulting in a truly interactive performance within a conventional musical framework. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations, showing that the learned improviser performs more interactive, musical, and human-like accompaniment compared with the less responsive, rule-based baseline algorithm.}

The parameters of the string model are controlled through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping.  The instrument is evaluated from a performing musician's perspective, and emerging playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument, yet with new kinds of control.  The contributions are two-fold. First, the use of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of "inside piano" playing, using multitouch keyboard data, allows for performance techniques going far beyond conventional keyboard playing.}

The loop pedal, is still the most used device for those types of performances, accounting for many of the cover songs performances on youtube, but not all kinds of song apply.  Unlike a common loop pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization.  In its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage, we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints, the new RL deals with pop music and has been already used in several in live concert situations.}

Some of the most precise physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.}

Instrument augmentation is a common approach for designing new interfaces for musical expression, as shown through hyperinstrument research.  New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes.  The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment.  The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer's hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.}

This paper will focus specifically on the combination of pitch data treated within tonal models and the detection of physical performance gestures using timbral feature extraction algorithms. We discuss how these tracked gestures may be connected to concepts and dynamic relationships from embodied cognition, expanding on performative models for pitch and timbre spaces. Finally, we explore how these ideas support connections between sonic, formal and performative dimensions. This includes instrumental technique detection scenes and mapping strategies aimed at bridging music performance gestures across physical and conceptual planes. }

It argues that the conventional model of composer-performer-listener, and the underlying mid-20th century metaphor of music as communication upon which it relies, cannot reflect the richness of interaction and possibility afforded by interactive digital technologies.  Building on Paul Lansky's vision of an expanded and dynamic social network, an alternative, ecological view of music-making is presented, in which meaning emerges not from "messages" communicated between individuals, but instead from the "noise" that arises through the uncertainty in their interactions. However, in our tendency in NIME to collapse the various roles in this network into a single individual, we place the increased potential afforded by digital systems at risk. Using examples from the author's NIME practices, the paper uses a practice-based methodology to describe approaches to designing instruments that respond to the technologies that form the interfaces of the network, which can include scores and stylistic conventions. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that a repertoire&#8212;a seemingly anachronistic concept&#8212;and a corresponding repertoire-driven approach to creating NIMEs can in fact be a catalyst for invention and creativity.}

As physical and digital assemblages, interfaces also act as traces of the authoring entities that created them.

In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined.}

This is something we know, performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.}

This problem becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces.  Most existing solutions to these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small screens).  Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual objects.  Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces. We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing gestural musical instruments.}

Vokinesis, a system for real-time rhythm and pitch modification and control of singing is presented.  Pitch and vocal effort are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The concept of Syllabic Control Points (SCP) is introduced for timing and rhythm control.  A chain of phonetic syllables have two types of temporal phases : the steady phases, which correspond to the vocalic nuclei, and the transient phases, which correspond to the attacks and/or codas. Thus, syllabic rhythm control methods need transient and steady phases control points, corresponding to the ancient concept of the arsis and thesis is prosodic theory. SCP allow for accurate control of articulation, using hand or feet. In the \emph{Tap mode}, SCP are triggered by pressing and releasing a control button. In the \emph{Fader mode}, continuous variation of the SCP sequencing rate is controlled with expression pedals.  Vokinesis has been tested successfully in musical performances, using both syllabic rhythm control modes. This system opens new musical possibilities, and can be extended to other types of sounds beyond voice. }

  abstract = {In the recent years, mechatronic musical instruments (MMI) have become increasingly parametrically rich. Researchers have developed different interaction strategies to negotiate the challenge of interfacing with each of the MMI's high-resolution parameters in real time. While mapping strategies hold an important aspect of the musical interaction paradigm for MMI, attention on dedicated input devices to perform these instruments live should not be neglected. This paper presents the findings of a user study conducted with participants possessing specialized musicianship skills for MMI music performance and composition. Study participants are given three musical tasks to complete using a mechatronic chordophone with high dimensionality of control via different musical input interfaces (one input device at a time). This representative user study reveals the features of related-dedicated input controllers, how they compare against the typical MIDI keyboard/sequencer paradigm in human-MMI interaction, and provide an indication of the musical function that expert users prefer for each input interface.}

  abstract = {The didgeridoo is a wind instrument composed of a single large tube often used as drone instrument for backing up the mids and lows of an ensemble. A didgeridoo is played by buzzing the lips and blowing air into the didgeridoo. To play a didgeridoo continously one can employ circular breathing but the volume of air required poses a real challenge to novice players. In this paper we replace the expense of circular breathing and lip buzzing with electronic excitation, thus creating an electro-acoustic didgeridoo or electronic didgeridoo. Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers and controllable from a computer. To properly drive the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the need for circular breathing.  }

  abstract = {This paper presents a knowledge-based, data-driven method for using data describing action-sound couplings collected from a group of people to generate multiple complex mappings between the performance movements of a musician and sound synthesis.  This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters.  A series of sound stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument they are given.  Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus.  The dataset created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define mappings for real-time performance.  To better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.}

While producing EDM, creating the drum track tends to be delicate, yet labor intensive work.  In this work we present a touch-interface-based prototype with the goal to simplify this task.  The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances.  Starting with a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated.  The interface provides simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns.  Variations are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library.  To evaluate the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in EDM production was conducted.  It was found that participants responded positively to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns.  Furthermore, the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations and live performances.}

In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service. The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the 60's physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming videos from the platform as musical materials in computer music and introduce a live coding environment that we developed for real-time improvisation.  }

  abstract = {The JoyStyx Quartet is a series of four embedded acoustic instruments. Each of these instruments is a five-voice granular synthesizer which processes a different sound source to give each a unique timbre and range. The performer interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay under the performer's fingertips.  The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2.  The nature of the JoyStyx construction causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry, leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more ``analog'' or ``natural'' sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert, the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.}

To broaden access to designing unique languages-as-instruments we developed an online programming environment that offers liveness in the process of language design as well as performance.  The editor utilizes the Parsing Expression Grammar formalism for language design, and a virtual machine featuring collaborative multitasking for execution, in order to support a diversity of language concepts and affordances.

In contrast to this approach, this paper outlines a philosophical position concerning the relationship between instruments and performers in improvisational contexts that recognises the agency of the instrument within the performance process. It builds on a post-phenomenological understanding of the human/instrument relationship in which the human and the instrument are understood as co-defining entities without fixed boundaries; an approach that actively challenges notions of instrumental mastery and &#8216;absolute control'. This paper then takes a practice-based approach to outline how such philosophical concerns have fed into the design of an augmented, actuated cello system, The Feral Cello, that has been designed to explicitly explore these concerns through practice.  }

Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to refer to this category. There are no "plug-n-play" solutions for a BCMI, these kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial expressions, from the user's brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the device's adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also question its reliability and robustness.}

In preparation for its deployment in a real-world performance setting the team conducted a user study aimed to define relevant constraints of the Google Glass display. Based on the observed data, a conductor part from an existing laptop orchestra piece was retrofitted, thereby replacing the laptop with a Google Glass running Glasstra and a similarly inconspicuous forearm-mounted Wiimote controller. Below we present findings from the user study that have informed the design of the visual display, as well as multi-perspective observations from a series of real-world performances, including the designer, user, and the audience. We use findings to offer a new hypothesis, an inverse uncanny valley or what we refer to as uncanny mountain pertaining to audience's potential distraction with the technology within the context of a live technology-mediated music performance as a function of minimizing on-stage technological footprint.}

  abstract = {While most musical robots that are capable of playing the drum kit utilise a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-hat, with the additional degree of motion provided by its pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians to use.  This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously calibrate the hi-hat's action both before and during a musical performance. This is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms.  This new approach allows musicians to create expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment. }

We promote tangible interaction as an alternative learning method in the creation of synthetic soundscape based on sounds recorded in a natural outdoor environment as main sources of sound. We investigate how schoolchildren perceive natural sources of sound and explore practices that reuse prerecorded material through a tangible interactive controller. We discuss the potential benefits of using TUIs as an alternative empirical method for tangible learning and interaction design, and its impact on encouraging and motivating creativity in children. We summarize our findings and review children's biehavioural indicators of engagement and enjoyment in order to provide insight to the design of TUIs based on user experience.}

The constraints are applied in two forms: i) Physically implemented on the instruments themselves, and ii) hidden rules that are defined on a network between the instruments and triggered depending on the musical actions of the performers. Six experienced musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance. Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music may not fit with performers' true intentions. It was also found that when external musical material is introduced to guide the performers into a collective convergence, it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out of context.}

Multi-layer fabric sensors that detect touch, proximity, electric field, pressure, and stretch are machine-sewn in a keyboard pattern on a stretchable substrate. The result is a fabric-based musical controller that combines both the discrete controls of a keyboard and various continuous controls from the embedded fabric sensors. This enables unique tactile experiences and new interactions both with physical and non-contact gestures: physical by pressing, pulling, stretching, and twisting the keys or the fabric and non-contact by hovering and waving towards/against the keyboard and an electromagnetic source. We have also developed additional fabric-based modular interfaces such as a ribbon-controller and trackpad, allowing performers to add more expressive and continuous controls. This paper will discuss implementation strategies for our system-on-textile, fabric-based sensor developments, as well as sensor-computer interfacing and musical mapping examples of this multi-modal and expressive fabric keyboard.  }

The classic foot activated effect pedals that are used to alter the sound of the instrument are stationary, forcing the performer to return to the same location in order to interact with the pedals. This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the effect pedals anywhere on the stage. By designing a foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller, we kept the strongest part of the classical pedal design, while allowing the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance has been recorded and compared, and their opinion has been investigated through questionnaire and interview. The results of the experiment showed that, in theory, foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller can replace standard effect pedals and at the same time provide more mobility on a stage. }

The project was conducted by both the students of the music therapy and multimedia composition programs and has thus offered rare insights into the dynamic of such undertakings covering both the therapeutic underpinnings, as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular result.  DJster, the engine we used for the generative processes is based on Clarence Barlow's probabilistic algorithms. Equipped with the proper periphery (sensors, sound modules and spatializers), we looked at three different scenarios, each requiring specific musical and technological solutions. The pilot was concluded by a symposium in 2017 and the development of a prototype system. The symposium yielded a diagram detailing the circular dynamic of the factors involved in this particular project, while the prototype was demoed in 2016 at the HfMT facilities. The system will be installed permanently at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in June 2017.}

As a large degree of DMI evaluation is concerned with exploring the subjective experience: ergonomics, action-sound mappings and control intimacy; User Experience (UX) methods are increasingly being utilised to analyse an individual's experience of new musical instruments, from which we can extract meaningful, robust findings and subsequently generalised and useful recommendations. However, many music interaction evaluations remain informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014 -- 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to highlight methods from UX's widening field of research that have not yet been explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.}

  abstract = {The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument designed to reinterpret and reflect upon the sounds of the instruments it is performed in collaboration with. At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques and settings. These are explored through case studies in a five year history of Fragment String-based compositions and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations of these interactions and their sonic output.  }

The overall user experience offered by the technology can be described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram.  &#160; More specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the dynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together determine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of this visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides real-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved by the user.  Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a floating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly overlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are symbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up within a grid if the instance is providing output to the user.  &#160; We discuss the system's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications. This from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the uniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of new forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently presented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.}

However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle but important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers ``go beyond the obvious'', and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of ``sound and feeling'' are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.}

The string-plate model is formulated in a way that prioritises its parametric explorability.

  abstract = {This paper presents the next stage of an investigation into the potential of historical theatre sound effects as a resource for Sonic Interaction Design (SID). An acoustic theatre wind machine was constructed, and a digital physical modelling-based version of this specific machine was programmed using the Sound Designer's Toolkit (SDT) in Max/MSP. The acoustic wind machine was fitted with 3D printed gearing to mechanically drive an optical encoder and control the digital synthesis engine in real time. The design of this system was informed by an initial comparison between the acoustic wind machine and the first iteration of its digital counterpart. To explore the main acoustic parameters and the sonic range of the acoustic and digital wind machines in operation, three simple and distinct rotational gestures were performed, with the resulting sounds recorded simultaneously, facilitating an analysis of the real-time performance of both sources. The results are reported, with an outline of future work. }

  abstract = {In this paper we present a discussion of the development of hardware systems in collaboration with professional artists, a context which presents both challenges and opportunities for researchers interested in the uses of technology in artistic practice. The establishment of design specifications within these contexts can be challenging, especially as they are likely to change during the development process. In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability.  Examples drawn from our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for artistic creation and reusability. We argue that the consideration of these design aspects at appropriate times within the development process may facilitate the ability of hardware systems to support continued use in professional applications.}

The second part presents the prototype instrument MicroMyo, built around the concept of making sound with little motion. The instrument plays with the convention that inputting more energy into an instrument results in more sound. MicroMyo, on the other hand, is built so that the less you move, the more it sounds. Our user study shows that while such an "inverse instrument" may seem puzzling at first, it also opens a space for interesting musical interactions. }

Unlike other domain-specific languages for sound synthesis and audio processing, Stride can generate optimized code that can run on any supported hardware platform. The generated code can be compiled to run on a full featured operating system or bare metal on embedded devices. Stride goes further and enables a designer to consolidate various supported hardware and software platforms, define the communication between them, and target them as a single heterogeneous system.}

GeKiPe was used for the creation of a collaborative stage performance (Sculpt), in which the musician and their movements are captured by different methods (infrared Kinect cameras and gesture-sensors on controller gloves). The use of GeKiPe as an alternate sound and image controller allowed us to combine body movement, musical gestures and audiovisual expressions to create challenging collaborative performances.}

We investigated how DAF (73ms and 250ms) affects musically trained (MT) and non-musically trained (NMT) people's ability to synchronize the audible strum of an actuated guitar to a metronome at 60bpm and 120bpm. The long DAF matched a subdivision of the overall tempo. We compared their performance using two different input devices with feedback before or on activation. While 250ms DAF hardly affected musically trained participants, non-musically trained participants' performance declined substantially both in mean synchronization error and its spread. Neither tempo nor input devices affected performance.}

NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology, engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies. Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing an alternative approach: musical organics .  Musical organics is a philosophical attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the Reactable.  This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical culture.}

The impulse response is obtained correlating a noise signal injected in the object through an acoustic actuator with the signal received from an acoustic sensor placed on the object. We also present an efficient multichannel implementation of the system, which enables further creative applications beyond audio filtering, including tangible signal patching and sound spatialization.}

Unlike other mechatronic guitar instruments that perform pre-programmed music automatically, this guitar allows the human and actuators to produce sounds jointly; there exists a distributed control between the human and robotic components. The interaction allows human performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with a rhythmic pattern.  Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports real-time interactive improvising.}

The boxes could be used together with any instrument, or on their own &#8211; in this case they create a feedback loop by listening and responding to each other, creating ever-changing rhythmic structures.  Feedboxes react to incoming sounds in simple, predefined manner. Yet, when used together, their behaviour may become quite complex. Each of two boxes has its own sound and set of simple rules.}

  abstract = {This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio processing are utilized.  Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument's sound is modified by the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.}

More recent experiments have explored humans interfacing with musebot ensembles in various ways: including through electronic interfaces in which parametric control of high-level musebot parameters are used; message-based interfaces which allow human users to communicate with musebots in their own language; and interfaces through which musebots have jammed with human musicians. Here we report on the recent developments of human interaction with musebot ensembles and reflect on some of the implications of these developments for the design of metacreative music systems.}

At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected interview evidence about the participants' experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach.  The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment.  The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds so that there is space for interplay between the two.}

The software is used in the development a series of recordings, similarly titled as AM MODE. Programmed in Max/MSP, the software uses live audio input from individual instruments within the drum set as control parameters for modulation synthesis. By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers, audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications. The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming a sonic hybrid.  }

In CABOTO the score is viewed as a cartographic map explored by some navigators. These navigators traverse the score in a semi-autonomous way, scanning the graphic elements found along their paths. The system tries to challenge the boundaries between the concepts of composition, score, performance, instrument, since the musical result will depend both on the composed score and the way the navigators will traverse it during the live performance. }

Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.}

The Theremin Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremin's ability, enabling it to produce five distinct new textures beyond the original.  It also features a looping system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.   }

Borrowing the best from TidalCycles, Siren augments the pattern creation process by introducing various interface level features: a multi-channel sequencer, local and global parameters, mathematical expressions, and pattern history. It presents new opportunities for recording, refining, and reusing the playback information with the pattern roll component. Subsequently, the paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of Siren in the context of user interface design principles, which originates from the cognitive dimensions framework for musical notation design.}

Power, sound-input and sound-diffusion subsystems make the instrument autonomous and mobile. This instrument was designed in coordination with the development of an evening-length dance/music performance in which the performing musician is engaged in choreographed movements with the mobile instruments.  The design methodology relied on a participatory process that engaged an interdisciplinary team made up of technologists, musicians, composers, choreographers, and dancers.  The prototyping process relied on a mix of in-house and out-sourced digital fabrication processes intended to make the open source hardware and software design of the system accessible and affordable for other creators. }

Our objective was to design a device that affords exploratory modes of interaction with the performer's surroundings, as well as precise control over microtonal pitch content and other concomitant parameters.  The instrument is comprised of a hand-held wand, containing two piezo-electric transducers affixed to a pair of metal probes.  The performer uses the wand to physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals.  Input materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis, in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances.  We achieved gestural control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch.  As a unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partch's “monophonic fabric” of Just Intonation—specifically his conception of odentities, udentities, and a variable numerary nexus.  This system classifies pitch content based upon intervallic structures found in both the overtone and undertone series.  Our paper details the procedural challenges in designing the Harmonic Wand.}

  abstract = {Sansa is an extended sansula, a hyper-instrument that is similar in design and functionality to a kalimba or thumb piano. At the heart of this interface is a series of sensors that are used to augment the tone and expand the performance capabilities of the instrument. The sensor data is further exploited using the machine learning program Wekinator, which gives users the ability to interact and perform with the instrument using several different modes of operation. In this way, Sansa is capable of both solo acoustic performances as well as complex productions that require interactions between multiple technological mediums. Sansa expands the current community of hyper-instruments by demonstrating the ways that hardware and software can extend an acoustic instrument's functionality and playability in a live performance or studio setting.}

  abstract = {Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments. These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation, timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical expression stems from the “transitive” perspective that musical expression is an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical expression focus on an “intransitive” perspective, where musical meaning is generated as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative capabilities unique to robotic instruments.}

The design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), however, has generally been driven by idiosyncratic artistic concerns, Western art music and dance traditions of expert performance, and short-lived interactive art installations engaging a broader public of musical novices. These DMIs rarely engage with the problems of on-going use in musical communities with existing performance idioms, repertoire, and social codes with participants representing the full learning curve of musical skill, such as social dance. Our project, Interactive Tango Milonga, an interactive Argentine tango dance system for social dance addresses these challenges in order to innovate connection, the feeling of intense relation between dance partners, music, and the larger tango community. }

For the experiment, participants engage in a multi sensory vocal exercise with a limited set of guidance to obtain a wide spectrum of vocal performances across participants. We compare characteristics of those vocal practices to the participant's heart rate, breathing rate, electrodermal activity and mental states. We obtained significant results suggesting that we can correlate psychophysiological states with characteristics of the vocal practice if we also take into account biographical information, and in particular mea- surement of how much people “like” their own voice.}

The result was a modular system consisting of several VST plug-ins, which on the one hand provides a drum interface to create sounds and tones and on the other hand generates or manipulates music through dance movement, in order to simplify the understanding of more abstract characteristics of music. This paper describes the development of a new software concept for the prototype, which since then has been further developed and evaluated several times. This will improve the maintainability and extensibility of the system and eliminate design weaknesses. To do so, the existing system first will be analyzed and requirements for a new framework, which is based on the concepts of event driven architecture and dependency injection, will be defined. The components are then transferred to the new system and their performance is assessed. The approach chosen in this case study and the lessons learned are intended to provide a viable solution for solving similar problems in the development of modular VST-based NIMEs.}

This type of neural network has a compact structure and is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties, we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work, we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery of the CTRNN creative search space.}

Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of ‘hijacking' formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.}

We argue that the explicit consideration of idiomatic gestures throughout the life cycle of new instruments can facilitate the emergence of style and give rise to performances that can develop rich layers of meaning.}

  abstract = {Machine learning and deep learning has recently made a large impact in the artistic community. In many of these applications however, the model is often used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output defined in the synth engine.  The system relies on learning these movements from a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output, our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the Lightpad instrument.}

Audio-morphing as a special field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization. Using multi-touch gestures to manipulate audio-morphing in a visual way, sound design and music production becomes more unrestricted and creative.}

Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However, the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments. Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not “tone deaf”. Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30% faster compared with learning from videos.}

Not all new musical instruments are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition of being new. So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers' practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.}

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in awareness of the underrepresentation of women in the sound and music computing fields. The New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference is not an exception, with a number of open questions remaining around the issue. In the present paper, we study the presence and evolution over time of women authors in NIME since the beginning of the conference in 2001 until 2017. We discuss the results of such a gender imbalance and potential solutions by summarizing the actions taken by a number of worldwide initiatives that have put an effort into making women's work visible in our field, with a particular emphasis on Women in Music Tech (WiMT), a student-led organization that aims to encourage more women to join music technology, as a case study. We conclude with a hope for an improvement in the representation of women in NIME by presenting WiNIME, a public online database that details who are the women authors in NIME.}

  abstract = {An oft-cited aspiration of digital musical instrument (DMI) design is to create instruments, in the words of Wessel and Wright, with a ‘low entry fee and no ceiling on virtuosity'. This is a difficult task to achieve: many new instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performer's movement translates into the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians. In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness. This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result only seems to be true for expert players.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the prevailing longevity problem of digital musical instruments (DMIs) in NIME research and design by proposing a holistic system design approach. Despite recent efforts to examine the main contributing factors of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to remedy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts establishing themselves, their design processes and technologies. However, few existing studies have attempted to proactively build a community around technological platforms for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and activities necessary for a budding community. We observe that such attempts while important in their undertaking, are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic factors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must not only take into account a target community but it may also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sustains artistic practice.}

The prototype system uses a two octave keyboard with each octave controlling one audio track. Each audio track has four two-bar loops which play in synchronisation switchable by its respective octave's first four black keys. The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface. All subjects agreed that all tools had creative performance potential that could be developed by further practice.}

CPGs are neural networks which generate adaptive rhythmic signals. They simulate structures in animals which underly behaviours such as heartbeat, gut peristalsis and complex motor control. Neurythmic is the first such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties of the CPG networks used (Matsuoka's Neural Oscillator), and describe methods for their control. Evaluation with expert and professional musicians shows that Neurythmic is a versatile tool, adapting well to a range of quite different musical approaches.}

  abstract = {Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface, finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between compositions that used either interface.}

In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor – two motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters. Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system. When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.}

This research compared three approaches to capturing hand gestures where the shape of the hand, i.e. the relative positions and angles of finger joints, are an important part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages for music applications. This study compared three approaches, using optical, inertial and muscular information, with three sets of 5 hand postures (i.e. static gestures) and gesture recognition algorithms applied to the device data, aiming to determine which methods are most effective.}

  abstract = {JythonMusic is a software environment for developing interactive musical experiences and systems.  It is based on jMusic, a software environment for computer-assisted composition, which was extended within the last decade into a more comprehensive framework providing composers and software developers with libraries for music making, image manipulation, building graphical user interfaces, and interacting with external devices via MIDI and OSC, among others.  This environment is free and open source.  It is based on Python, therefore it provides more economical syntax relative to Java- and C/C++-like languages.  JythonMusic rests on top of Java, so it provides access to the complete Java API and external Java-based libraries as needed.  Also, it works seamlessly with other software, such as PureData, Max/MSP, and Processing.  The paper provides an overview of important JythonMusic libraries related to constructing interactive musical experiences.  It demonstrates their scope and utility by summarizing several projects developed using JythonMusic, including interactive sound art installations, new interfaces for sound manipulation and spatialization, as well as various explorations on mapping among motion, gesture and music.}

With the Triplexer, we aim to expand the performer's control space by augmenting the capabilities of the common expression pedal that is found in most effects rigs. Using industrial-grade weight-detection sensors and widely-adopted communication protocols, the Triplexer offers a flexible platform that can be integrated into various performance setups and situations. In this paper, we detail the design of the Triplexer by describing its hardware, embedded signal processing, and mapping software implementations. We also offer the results of a user study, which we conducted to evaluate the usability of our controller.}

An important objective of the project has been to encourage its use by practicing musicians. After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: “why do musicians want to use this instrument?” and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument.
This paper describes the halldorophone and presents the rationale for its major design features and ergonomic choices, as they relate to the overarching objective of nurturing a culture of use and connects it to wider trends.}

The recent increase in interest and investment in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel methods for musicians to create and interact with music. To this end, a number of nontraditional instruments have been constructed that enable musicians to control sound production beyond pitch and volume, integrating filtering, musical effects, etc. Wii Remotes (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use in maker communities, including laptop orchestras, for their robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music creation. In this paper, the authors present a new controller design, based on the WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-centric music performance. Based on the pilot-study data, the new controller offers unrestricted two-hand gesture production, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.}

Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to further investigate and extend this approach.}

Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication. In this paper we discuss this technique as well as aspects of the geometry of stadium cymbals and their impact on the resulting instrument.}

Through two experiments, the perceptual significance and overall musical contribution of the addition of haptic feedback in a listening context was evaluated. Subjects preferred listening to the classical guitar presentation with the addition of haptic feedback and the addition of haptic feedback contributed to listeners' engagement with a performance. The results of the experiments and their implications are discussed in this paper.}

Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed varying degrees of `guitar-likeness', based either on the form and aesthetics of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures.}

The intervention lasted three weeks during which the participant had a fully functional electrical guitar fitted with a strumming device controlled by a foot pedal at his free disposal. The device replaced right strumming of the strings, and the study showed that the participant, who was highly motivated, played 20 sessions despite system latency and reduced musical expression. He incorporated his own literature and equipment into his playing routine and improved greatly as the study progressed. He was able to play alone and keep a steady rhythm in time with backing tracks that went as fast as 120bpm. During the study he was able to lower his error rate to 33%, while his average flutter also decreased.}

We discuss a performance-driven ecosystemic approach to studying musical relationships, drawing on arguments from the literature which emphasise the need to go beyond simplistic notions of control and usability when assessing exploratory and performatory musical interactions. Lastly, we focus on processes of perceptual learning and co-tuning between musician and instrument, and how these activities may contribute to the emergence of personal style as a hallmark of skilful music-making.}

Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this first iteration "Cabled Madness" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration "Onward to Mars" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit backpack. Now 10 years on, a new {robotcowboy 2.0} system powers a third iteration with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author's open-source iOS application which runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller support, and Open Sound Control communication.

It consisted of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind, and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional `performance' technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound, and vibration, and that the `inverse' control of the instrument was both challenging and pleasant.}

  abstract = {We present our work in progress on the development of a web-based system for music performance with virtual instruments in a virtual 3D environment, which provides three means of interaction (i.e physical, gestural and mixed), using tracking data from a Leap Motion sensor. Moreover, our system is integrated as a creative tool within the context of a STEAM education platform that promotes science learning through musical activities. The presented system models string and percussion instruments, with realistic sonic feedback based on Modalys, a physical model-based sound synthesis engine. Our proposal meets the performance requirements of real-time interactive systems and is implemented strictly with web technologies.}

  abstract = {We developed a new musical interface, CubeHarmonic, with the magnetic tracking system, IM3D, created at Tohoku University. IM3D system precisely tracks positions of tiny, wireless, battery-less, and identifiable LC coils in real time. The CubeHarmonic is a musical application of the Rubik's cube, with notes on each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get different chords and chord sequences. Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik's cube, and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a recreational tool.}

The goal with the project is to give guitarists a way to interact with dynamic effects control that feels familiar to their instrument and playing style. A 3D-printed prototype has been made. It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.}

A new student to the instrument is faced with mastering multiple, interconnected physical movements in order to become a skillful player. In their development, one measure of a players quality is their tone, which is the result of the combination of the physical characteristics of the instrument and their technique in playing it. This paper describes preliminary research into creating an intuitive, real-time device for evaluating the quality of tone generation on the cello: a ``timbre-tuner'' to aid cellists evaluate their tone quality. Data for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at different pitches on the A string was created. Results from informal listening tests support the use of the harmonic centroid as an appropriate measure for tone quality.}

Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.}

In a course of performance-led research four prototypes were built and analyzed them using concepts from NIME and creative collaboration literature. Based on this analysis it was found that the systems should 1) provide a commonly modifiable visual representation of musical data for both coder and non-coder, and 2) provide some independent means of sound production for each user, giving the non-coder the ability to slow down and make non-realtime decisions for greater performance flexibility. }

Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the ‘sensor layer' brings with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response. }

This work investigates a series of discrete-time chaotic maps, which have the potential to generate intriguing sounds when they are adjusted to be on the edge of chaos.  With these chaotic maps as studied historically, the edge of chaos tends to be razor-thin, which can make it difficult to employ them for making new musical instruments.  The authors therefore suggest connecting chaotic maps with digital waveguides, which (1) make it easier to synthesize harmonic tones and (2) make it harder to fall off of the edge of chaos while playing a musical instrument.  The authors argue therefore that this technique widens the razor-thin edge of chaos into a musical highway.}

In these situations, composition and control of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy approach. }

Participants were filmed and interviewed for the later analysis of their different multimodal associations about music. Our initial hypothesis was that most of the physical mock-ups would be similar to the sound-producing objects that participants would identify in the musical pieces. Although the majority of artifacts clearly showed correlated design trajectories, our results indicate that a relevant number of participants intuitively decided to engineer alternative solutions emphasizing their personal design preferences. Therefore, in this paper we present and discuss the workshop format, its results and the possible applications for designing new musical interfaces.}

  abstract = {The Symbaline is an active instrument comprised of several partly-filled wine glasses excited by electromagnetic coils. This work describes an electromechanical system for incorporating frequency and amplitude modulation to the Symbaline's sound. A pendulum having a magnetic bob is suspended inside the liquid in the wine glass. The pendulum is put into oscillation by driving infra-sound signals through the coil. The pendulum's movement causes the liquid in the glass to slosh back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass sounds are produced by driving audio-range signals through the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to the glass surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the glass vibrates, the sloshing liquid periodically changes the glass's resonance frequencies and dampens the glass, thus modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the SIBILIM, a low-cost musical interface composed of a resonance box made of cardboard containing customised push buttons that interact with a smartphone through its video camera. Each button can be mapped to a set of MIDI notes or control parameters. The sound is generated through synthesis or sample playback and can be amplified with the help of a transducer, which excites the resonance box. An essential contribution of this interface is the possibility of reconfiguration of the buttons layout without the need to hard rewire the system since it uses only the smartphone built-in camera. This features allow for quick instrument customisation for different use cases,
such as low cost projects for schools or instrument building  workshops. Our case study used the Sibilim for music education, where it was designed to develop the conscious of music perception and to stimulate creativity through exercises of short tonal musical compositions. We conducted a study with a group of twelve participants in an experimental workshop to verify its validity.}

An overview of BLE MIDI is presented along with a comparison of the protocol from the perspective of theoretical limits and interoperability, showing its widespread compatibility across platforms compared with other alternatives. Then we perform three complementary tests on BLE MIDI and alternative interfaces using prototype and commercial devices, showing that BLE MIDI has comparable performance with the tested WiFi implementations, with end-to-end (sensor input to audio output) latencies of under 10ms under certain conditions. Overall, BLE MIDI is an ideal choice for controllers and sensor interfaces that are designed to work on a wide variety of platforms.}

We explore the performers' roles during two performances when these socio-technical systems were implemented, in terms of coordination, problem-solving, managing uncertainty and musical responses to system constraints. This allows us to consider how features of these systems and practices might be incorporated into a general tool, aimed at any musician, which could scale for use in different performance settings involving interactive media. }

  abstract = {Although several Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been presented at NIME, very few of them remain accessible to the community. Rebuilding a DMI is often a necessary step to allow for performance with NIMEs. Rebuilding a DMI exactly similar to its original, however, might not be possible due to technology obsolescence, lack of documentation or other reasons. It might then be interesting to re-interpret a DMI and build an instrument inspired by the original one, creating novel performance opportunities. This paper presents the challenges and approaches involved in rebuilding and re-interpreting an existing DMI, The Sponge by Martin Marier. The rebuilt versions make use of newer/improved technology and customized design aspects like addition of vibrotactile feedback and implementation of different mapping strategies. It also discusses the implications of embedding sound synthesis within the DMI, by using the Prynth framework and further presents a comparison between this approach and the more traditional ground-up approach. As a result of the evaluation and comparison of the two rebuilt DMIs, we present a third version which combines the benefits and discuss performance issues with these devices.}

The performer controls a bank of 64 virtual inter-connected resonating strings, with individual and direct control of tuning and resonance characteristics through a multitouch-enhanced klavier interface (TouchKeys). It is a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument, as all string vibrations originate from physical vibrations in the klavier and its casing, captured through contact microphones. In addition, there are gestural strings, called ropes, excited by performed musical gestures. All strings and ropes are connected, and inter-resonate together as a ”super-harp”, internally and through the performance space. With strong resonance, strings may go into chaotic motion or emergent quasi-periodic patterns, but custom adaptive leveling mechanisms keep loudness under the musician's control at all times. The hybrid digital/acoustic approach and the enhanced keyboard provide for an expressive and very physical interaction, and a strong multi-channel immersive experience. The paper describes the aesthetic choices behind the design of the system, as well as the technical implementation, and – primarily – the interaction design, as it emerges from mapping, sound design, physical modeling and integration of the acoustic, the gestural, and the virtual. The work is evaluated based on the experiences from a series of performances.}

Specifically, these are instruments that are physical in that they use bodily interaction, take advantage of the physical affordances of the laptop. They are embodied in the sense that instruments are played in such ways where the sound is embedded to be close to the instrument. Three distinct laptop instruments, Taptop, Armtop, and Blowtop, are introduced in this paper. We discuss the integrity of the design process with composing for laptop instruments and performing with them. In this process, our aim is to blur the boundaries of the composer and designer/engineer roles. How the physicality is achieved by leveraging musical gestures gained through traditional instrument practice is studied, as well as those inspired by body gestures. We aim to explore how using such interaction methods affects the communication between the ensemble and the audience. An aesthetic-first qualitative evaluation of these interfaces is discussed, through works and performances crafted specifically for these instruments and presented in the concert setting of the laptop orchestra. In so doing, we reflect on how such physical, embodied instrument design practices can inform a different kind of expressive and performance mindset.}

Then, a gesture recognition system captures gestures that are sent to a sound generator software. The proposed method was used to stage an artistic show in which a Soundpainter had to improvise with 6 different gestures to generate a musical composition from different sounds in real time. The accuracy of the gesture recognition system was evaluated as well as Soundpainter's user experience. In addition, a user evaluation study for using our proposed system in a learning context was also conducted. Current results open up perspectives for the design of new artistic expressions based on the use of automatic gestural recognition supported by Soundpainting language.}

The paper presents three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate the guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which 11 guitarists tested the Magpick for five days and composed a piece with it. Reflecting on their comments and experiences, we outline the innovative features of this technology from the point of view of performance practice. In particular, compared to other augmentations, the high temporal resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the Magpick support a highly nuanced control over the sound. Our discussion highlights the utility of having the locus of augmentation coincide with the locus of interaction.}

  abstract = {Skini is a platform for composing and producing live performances with audience participating using connected devices (smartphones, tablets, PC, etc.). The music composer creates beforehand musical elements such as melodic patterns, sound patterns, instruments, group of instruments, and a dynamic score that governs the way the basic elements will behave according to events produced by the audience. During the concert or the performance, the audience, by interacting with the system, gives birth to an original music composition. Skini music scores are expressed in terms of constraints that establish relationships between instruments. A constraint maybe instantaneous, for instance one may disable violins while trumpets are playing. A constraint may also be temporal, for instance, the piano cannot play more than 30 consecutive seconds. The Skini platform is implemented in Hop.js and HipHop.js. HipHop.js, a synchronous reactive DLS, is used for implementing the music scores as its elementary constructs consisting of high level operators such as parallel executions, sequences, awaits, synchronization points, etc, form an ideal core language for implementing Skini constraints. This paper presents the Skini platform. It reports about live performances and an educational project. It briefly overviews the use of HipHop.js for representing score.}

This work aims the elaboration of a strategy in which several gestures performed in a joystick control can influence one or several parameters of the sound synthesis, making a mapping denominated many to many. Buttons combinations used to perform game actions that are common in fighting games, like Street Fighter, were mapped to the synthesizer to create a music. Experiments show that this mapping is capable of influencing the musical expression of a DMI making it closer to an acoustic instrument.}

Several DDMI have already been created, but they have been developed isolatedly, and there is still a lack of a common process of ideation and development. Knowledge about Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) and Interactive Dance Systems (IDSs) can contribute to the design of DDMI, but the former brings few contributions to the body's expressiveness, and the latter brings few references to an instrumental relationship with music. Because of those different premises, the integration between both paradigms can be an arduous task for the designer of DDMI. The conceptual framework of DDMI can also serve as a bridge between DMIs and IDSs, serving as a lingua franca between both communities and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. The conceptual framework has shown to be a promising analytical tool for the design, development, and evaluation of new digital dance and music instrument.}

  abstract = {T-Voks is an augmented theremin that controls Voks, a performative singing synthesizer. Originally developed for control with a graphic tablet interface, Voks allows for real-time pitch and time scaling, vocal effort modification and syllable sequencing for pre-recorded voice utterances. For T-Voks the theremin's frequency antenna modifies the output pitch of the target utterance while the amplitude antenna controls not only volume as usual but also voice quality and vocal effort. Syllabic sequencing is handled by an additional pressure sensor attached to the player's volume-control hand. This paper presents the system architecture of T-Voks, the preparation procedure for a song, playing gestures, and practice techniques, along with musical and poetic examples across four different languages and styles.}

Utilizing recent work in nonlinear acoustic synthesis, we propose a transducer based augmented percussion implement entitled DRMMR. This design enables the user to sustain computer sequencer-like drum rolls at faster speeds while also enabling the user to achieve nonlinear acoustic synthesis effects. Our acoustic evaluation shows drum rolls executed by DRMMR easily exhibit greater levels of regularity, speed, and precision than comparable transducer and electromagnetic-based actuation methods. DRMMR's nonlinear acoustic synthesis functionality also presents possibilities for new kinds of sonic interactions on the surface of drum membranes.}

Instrument designs are particularly influenced by cultural and aesthetic values linked to the specific contexts and communities that produced them. In previous work, we ran a design fiction workshop in which musicians created non-functional instrument mockups. In the current paper, we report on an online survey in which music technologists were asked to speculate on the background of the musicians who designed particular instruments. Our results showed several cues for the interpretation of the artefacts' origins, including physical features, body-instrument interactions, use of language and references to established music practices and tools. Tacit musical and cultural values were also identified based on intuitive and holistic judgments. Our discussion highlights the importance of cultural awareness and context-dependent values on the design and use of interactive musical systems.}

We have recently seen various improvements of interface design on tactile feedback and force guidance aiming to make instrument learning more effective. However, most interfaces are still quite static; they cannot yet sense the learning progress and adjust the tutoring strategy accordingly. To solve this problem, we contribute an adaptive haptic interface based on the latest design of haptic flute. We first adopted a clutch mechanism to enable the interface to turn on and off the haptic control flexibly in real time. The interactive tutor is then able to follow human performances and apply the “teacher force” only when the software instructs so. Finally, we incorporated the adaptive interface with a step-by-step dynamic learning strategy. Experimental results showed that dynamic learning dramatically outperforms static learning, which boosts the learning rate by 45.3% and shrinks the forgetting chance by 86%.}

These sensors each perform better or worse depending on the class of gesture the user is making, motivating sensor fusion practices. Residuals between Kalman filters and sensor output are calculated and used as input to a recurrent neural network which outputs a classification that determines which processing parameters and sensor measurements are employed. Multiple instances (30) of layer recurrent neural networks with a single hidden layer varying in size from 1 to 10 processing units were trained, and tested on previously unseen data. The best performing neural network has only 3 hidden units and has a sufficiently low error rate to be good candidate for gesture classification. This paper demonstrates that: dynamic networks out-perform feedforward networks for this type of gesture classification, a small network can handle a problem of this level of complexity, recurrent networks of this size are fast enough for real-time applications of this type, and the importance of training multiple instances of each network architecture and selecting the best performing one from within that set.}

Movement is tracked and mapped through extensive pre-processing to a high-dimensional acoustic space, using a many-to-many mapping, so that every small body movement matters. Designed for improvised exploration, it works as both performance and installation. Through this re-translation of bodily action, position, and posture into infinite-dimensional sound texture and timbre, the performers are invited to re-think and re-learn position and posture as sound, effort as gesture, and timbre as a bodily construction. The sound space can be shared by two people, with added modes of presence, proximity and interaction. The aesthetic background and technical implementation of the system are described, and the system is evaluated based on a number of performances, workshops and installation exhibits. Finally, the aesthetic and choreographic motivations behind the performance narrative are explained, and discussed in the light of the design of the sonification.}

A small scale review covers systems from two prominent UK-based companies, and two itera- tions of a new prototype system that were developed in collaboration with a small group of young people on the autistic spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects of musical experience that are made accessible differ with re- spect to the extent and nature of each system's constraints. It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype system facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques observed during its development. Based on these obser- vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni- ties for the emergence of personal practices and preferences in neurodiverse groups of children and young people, and that this is a fitting subject for further research.}

It works also as a performance instrument that stimulates collaborative remixings from compositions of scored interaction gestures called “scenes”. The interface also aims to be a platform to exchange those sample packs as artistic releases, a format similar to the popular idea of an “album”, but prepared to those four channel packs of samples and scores of interaction. It uses an adaptive audio slicing mechanism and it is based on interaction design for multi-touch screen features. A timing sequencer enhances the interaction between pre-set sequences (the “scenes”) and screen manipulation scratching, expanding and moving graphic sound waves. This paper describes the graphical interface features, some development decisions up to now and perspectives to its continuity.}

These are produced by a neural network that ensures that (with high probability) the melodic and rhythmic structure of the new melody is consistent with a given set of sample songs. We train a Variational Autoencoder network to identify a low-dimensional set of variables that allows for the compression and representation of sample songs. By perturbing these variables with Perlin Noise---a temporally-consistent parameterized noise function---it is possible to generate smoothly-changing novel melodies. We show that (1) by regulating the amount of noise, one can specify how much of the base song will be preserved; and (2) there is a direct correlation between the noise signal and the differences between the statistical properties of novel melodies and the original one. Users can interpret the controllable noise as a type of "creativity knob": the higher it is, the more leeway the network has to generate significantly different melodies. We present a physical prototype that allows musicians to use a keyboard to provide base melodies and to adjust the network's "creativity knobs" to regulate in real-time the process that proposes new melody ideas.}

We build upon previous work in sound-tracing and mapping-by-demonstration to ask the participants to design gestures with which to perform the given sounds using a multimodal, inertial measurement (IMU) and muscle sensing (EMG) device. We presented the user with four techniques for associating sensor input to synthesizer parameter output. Two were classical techniques from the literature, and two proposed different ways to capture dynamic gesture in a neural network. These four techniques were: 1.) A Static Position regression training procedure, 2.) A Hidden Markov based temporal modeler, 3.) Whole Gesture capture to a neural network, and 4.) a Windowed method using the position-based procedure on the fly during the performance of a dynamic gesture. Our results show trade-offs between accurate, predictable reproduction of the source sounds and exploration of the gesture-sound space. Several of the users were attracted to our new windowed method for capturing gesture anchor points on the fly as training data for neural network based regression. This paper will be of interest to musicians interested in going from sound design to gesture design and offers a workflow for quickly trying different mapping-by-demonstration techniques.}

The piece Vrengt grew from the idea of enabling a true partnership between a musician and a dancer, developing an instrument that would allow for active co-performance. Using a participatory design approach, we worked with sonification as a tool for systematically exploring the dancer's bodily expressions. The exploration used a "spatiotemporal matrix", with a particular focus on sonic microinteraction. In the final performance, two Myo armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the arm and leg of the dancer, together with a wireless headset microphone capturing the sound of breathing. In the paper we reflect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our approach to creating a shared instrument using sonification as a tool for the sound design, and reflect on the performers' subjective evaluation of the instrument.   }

Similarly, the instrument designer, composer, and performer are often the same person. The Academic Festival Overture is a new piece of music for the DMI Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written by a composer who had no prior experience with the instrument. The piece underwent the phases of a composition competition, rehearsals, a music video production, and a public live performance. This whole process was evaluated reflecting on the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the composer, the conductor, and the instrument designer as performer. `Blending dimensions' of these stakeholder and decoupling the composition from the instrument designer inspired the newly involved composer to completely rethink the DMI's interaction and sound concept. Thus, to deliberately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer and a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and at the same time the challenge to seek such a collaboration in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings and improvement.}

The proposed system is based on a natural language processing technique: word-based sequence-to-sequence learning using LSTM units. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that the system is not reliant on a voice-by-voice transcription of drums; instead, in this method, a drum representation is used as an input sequence from which a translated bassline is obtained at the output. The drum representation consists of fixed size sequences of onsets detected from a 2-bar audio drum loop in eight different frequency bands. The basslines generated by this method consist of pitched notes with different duration. The proposed system was trained on two distinct datasets compiled for this project by the authors. Each dataset contains a variety of 2-bar drum loops with annotated basslines from two different styles of dance music: House and Soca. A listening experiment designed based on the system revealed that the proposed system is capable of generating basslines that are interesting and are well rhythmically interlocked with the drum loops from which they were generated.}

Our results show that BLIKSEM is capable of generating signals that approximate the timbre and dynamic behaviors of conventional fuzz pedals, as well as offer new mechanisms for expressive interactions and a range of new effects in different configurations.}

The workshop is designed for master students with multidisciplinary backgrounds. They are encouraged to work in teams from two university campuses remotely connected through a portal space. The components of the workshop are prototyping, music improvisation and reflective practice. We report the results of this course, which show a positive impact on the students' confidence in prototyping and intention to continue in STEM fields. We also present the challenges and lessons learned on how to improve the teaching of hybrid technologies and programming skills in an interdisciplinary context across two locations, with the aim of satisfying both beginners and experts.

Users can point anywhere to interact with the system, and the spatial interaction utilizes motion capture, so it does not require a screen. Instead, it is completely controlled via hand gestures using a glove that is populated with motion-tracking markers.

The main purpose of this system is to offer intuitive physical interaction with the perimeter-based spatial sound sources. Further, its goal is to minimize user-worn technology and thereby enhance freedom of motion by utilizing environmental sensing devices, such as motion capture cameras or infrared sensors. The ensuing creativity enabling technology is applicable to a broad array of possible scenarios, from researching limits of human spatial hearing perception to facilitating learning and artistic performances, including dance.

Rather than predicting symbolic music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future control data from the user and precise temporal information can lead to new and interesting interactive possibilities. We propose that a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predictions can be used to fill-in control data when the user stops performing, or as a kind of filter on the user's own input. We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive musical interaction by recording datasets, training MDRNN models, and experimenting with interaction modes. We illustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying this idea. Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive interaction is viable even on single-board computers and that small models are appropriate for small datasets.}

The created models learn the mapping between input and output images using a training set of either paired or unpaired images. We qualitatively assess the visual outcomes based on three image-to-image translation models: reconstructing interfaces from edge maps, and collection style transfers based on two image sets: visuals of mosaic tile patterns and geometric abstract two-dimensional arts. This paper aims to demonstrate that synthesizing interface layouts based on image-to-image translation techniques can yield insights for researchers, musicians, music technology industrial designers, and the broader NIME community.}

  abstract = {When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is often of interest to retain an instrument's sound quality and nuanced response while leveraging the richness of digital synthesis.  Digital audio has traditionally been generated through speakers, separating sound generation from the instrument itself, or by adding an actuator within the instrument's resonating body, imparting new sounds along with the original.  We offer a third option, isolating the playing interface from the actuated resonating body, allowing us to rewrite the relationship between performance action and sound result while retaining the general form and feel of the acoustic instrument.  We present a hybrid acoustic-electronic violin based on a stick-body electric violin and an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing individual string displacements.  A conventional violin body acts as the resonator, actuated using digitally altered audio of the string inputs.  By attaching the electric violin above the body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical playing experience of a normal violin along with some of the acoustic filtering and radiation of a traditional build.  We propose the use of the hybrid instrument with digitally automated pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for use as a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.}

Also, players make physical motions and, in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians' artistic intentions. However, it's not clear if the sound manipulation reflects in physical motions. The understanding of the musical structure of the work being performed in its many levels may impact the projection of artistic intentions, and performers alter it in micro and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs, phrases and sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing manipulation and how such variations may reflect in physical gestures. The study involved musicians (flute, clarinet, and bassoon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini. We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the Inter Onsets Interval deviations) and physical motion based on the traveled distance of the flute under different conditions. The flutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in three experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing in duets with previous recordings by other instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. The finding suggests that: 1) the movements, which seem to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent and stable, 2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reflects in gestures' amplitude performed by flutists.}

The actual action-sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and processed in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the acoustical domain alone. The control parameters are captured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm proprieties like filter cutoff frequency, frequency shift or overdrive. The instrument opens up the possibility for a large selection of different interaction techniques that have a direct impact on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a sound designer's perspective, encouraging exploration in the materials used as well as techniques. The contribution are two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer to augment the Sensel Morph affords an extra dimension of control on top of the offerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from physical interactions as a source for excitation and manipulation of an audio processing system offers a large variety of new sounds to be discovered. The methodology involved an exploratory process of iterative instrument making, interspersed with observations gathered via improvisatory trials, focusing on the new interactions made possible through the fusion of audio-rate inputs with the Morph's default interaction methods.}

However, most systems rely on a small predefined set of descriptors, which the user is often required to understand and choose from.

In addition, this method does not scale to longer samples that require higher-dimensional descriptions, which biases systems towards the use of short samples. In this paper we propose novel framework for automatic creation of interactive sound spaces from sound collections using feature learning and dimensionality reduction. The framework is implemented as a software library using the SuperCollider language. We compare several algorithms and describe some example interfaces for interacting with the resulting spaces. Our experiments signal the potential of unsupervised algorithms for creating data-driven musical interfaces.}

In addition, the paper describes some of the current issues of web audio music applications and offers strategies for integrating a web-based presentation layer with a low-latency native processing backend.}

  abstract = {Generating convincing music via deep neural networks is a challenging problem that shows promise for many applications including interactive musical creation. One part of this challenge is the problem of generating convincing accompaniment parts to a given melody, as could be used in an automatic accompaniment system. Despite much progress in this area, systems that can automatically learn to generate interesting sounding, as well as harmonically plausible, accompanying melodies remain somewhat elusive. In this paper we explore the problem of sequence to sequence music generation where a human user provides a sequence of notes, and a neural network model responds with a harmonically suitable sequence of equal length. We consider two sequence-to-sequence models; one featuring standard unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, and the other featuring bidirectional LSTM, both successfully trained to produce a sequence based on the given input. Both of these are fairly dated models, as part of the investigation is to see what can be achieved with such models. These are evaluated and compared via a qualitative study that features 106 respondents listening to eight random samples from our set of generated music, as well as two human samples. From the results we see a preference for the sequences generated by the bidirectional model as well as an indication that these sequences sound more human.}

Bendit\_I/O brings the networking techniques of distributed music performances to the hardware hacking realm, opening the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi- enabled I/O board and a Node-based server, the system provides performers with a variety of interaction and control possibilities between connected users and hacked devices. Moreover, it is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular, making it a flexible toolset for artists of diverse experience levels.}

Individuals interact with the installation by wearing a brainwave interface that measures the strength of the alpha wave signal. The interface then transmits the data to a computer that uses it in order to determine the individual's overall state of relaxation. As the individual achieves higher states of relaxation, mechatronic instruments respond and provide feedback. This feedback not only encourages self-awareness but also it motivates the individual to relax further. Visitors without the headset experience the installation by watching a film and listening to an original musical score. Through the novel arrangement of technologies and features, 'Where Is The Quiet?' demonstrates that mediated technological experiences are capable of evoking meditative states of consciousness, facilitating individual and group connectivity, and deepening awareness of the natural world. As such, this installation opens the door to future research regarding the possibility of immersive experiences supporting humanitarian needs.}

Longevity is generally regarded as a valuable quality that good design criteria should help to achieve. However, the nature of the tools, of the performance conditions and of the music itself may lead to think of ephemerality as an intrinsic modality of the existence of DMIs. In particular, the conditions of contemporary musical production suggest that contextual adaptations of instrumental devices beyond the monolithic unity of classical instruments should be considered. The first two parts of this article analyse various reasons to reassess the issue of longevity and ephemerality. The last two sections attempt to propose an articulation of these two aspects to inform both the design of the DMI and their learning.}

A fabric soft case fixed to the instrument`s body holds the PICO modules: the touchscreen, the single board computer, the sound card, the speaker system and the DC power bank. The device audio specifications arose from musicological insights about the social role of performers in their musical contexts and the instruments' playing techniques. They were taken as design challenges in the creation process of PICO`s first prototype, which was submitted to a short evaluation. Along with the construction of PICO, we reflected over the design of an interactive audio interface as a mode of research. Therefore, the paper will also discuss methodological aspects of audio hardware design.}

The theoretical reference approached is linked to the embodied cognition, with unfolding related to the cognitive semantics and the enactivist current of cognitive sciences, among other domains of contemporary sciences of mind and neuroscience. The experiments involve the relationship between music and movement, based on prior research using as a reference context in which it is not possible to establish a clear distinction between them: the Capoeira. Finally, we proposes a discussion about the application of the theoretical approach in two compositions: Boreal IV, for Steel Drums and real time electronics, and Converse, collaborative multimedia piece for piano, real-time audio (Puredata) and video processing (GEM and live video) and a dancer.}

As expressive instruments, they offer multiple techniques to create and manipulate sounds using their actuation mechanisms. Chordophone designs have taken multiple forms, from frames that play a guitar-like instrument, to machines that integrate strings and actuators as part of their frame. However, few of these instruments have taken advantage of dynamics, which have been largely unexplored. This paper details the design and construction of a new picking mechanism prototype which enables expressive techniques through fast and precise movement and actuation. We have adopted iterative design and rapid prototyping strategies to develop and refine a compact picker capable of creating dynamic variations reliably. Finally, a quantitative evaluation process demonstrates that this system offers the speed and consistency of previously existing picking mechanisms, while providing increased control over musical dynamics and articulations.}

Our hypothesis is that using evolutionary algorithms with VR for musical interactions will lead to increased user telepresence.

Think aloud trials and thematic analysis revealed 5 main themes: control, comparison to the real world, immersion, general usability and limitations, in addition to practical improvements. Overall, it was found that this combination of technologies did improve telepresence levels, proving the original hypothesis correct.}

  abstract = {Harriet Padberg wrote Computer-Composed Canon and Free Fugue as part of her 1964 dissertation in Mathematics and Music at Saint Louis University. This program is one of the earliest examples of text-to-music software and algorithmic composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-day field of music technology. This paper aims to analyze the technological innovation, aesthetic design process, and impact of Harriet Padberg's original 1964 thesis as well as the design of a modern recreation and utilization, in order to gain insight to the nature of revisiting older works. Here, we present our open source recreation of Padberg's program with a modern interface and, through its use as an artistic tool by three composers, show how historical works can be effectively used for new creative purposes in contemporary contexts. Not Even One by Molly Jones draws on the historical and social significance of Harriet Padberg through using her program in a piece about the lack of representation of women judges in composition competitions. Brevity by Anna Savery utilizes the original software design as a composition tool, and The Padberg Piano by Anthony Caulkins uses the melodic generation of the original to create a software instrument.}

One approach, geared toward real-time control, uses low dimensional gestural controllers and learned mappings from control spaces to parameter spaces, making use of an intermediate latent timbre distribution, such that the control space affords a spatially-intuitive arrangement of sonic possibilities. Whereas many existing systems present alternatives to the traditional parametric interfaces, the proposed system explores ways in which feature-based synthesis can augment one-to-one parameter control, made possible by fully invertible mappings between control and parameter spaces.}

  abstract = {Modern computer music performances often involve a musical instrument that is primarily digital; software runs on a computer, and the physical form of the instrument is the computer. In such a practice, the performance interface is rendered on a computer screen for the performer. There has been a concern in using a laptop as a musical instrument from the audience's perspective, in that having ``a laptop performer sitting behind the screen'' makes it difficult for the audience to understand how the performer is creating music.  Mirroring a computer screen on a projection screen has been one way to address the concern and reveal the performer's instrument. This paper introduces and discusses the author's computer music practice, in which a performer actively considers screen mirroring as an essential part of the performance, beyond visualization of music. In this case, screen mirroring is not complementary, but inevitable from the inception of the performance. The related works listed within explore various roles of screen mirroring in computer music performance and helps us understand empirical and logistical findings in such practices.}

Fiber optic cables are separated into bundles and then woven like a basket into a bendable glowing fabric. By equipping light emitting diodes to one side of these bundles and photodiode light intensity sensors to the other, loss of light intensity can be measured when the fabric is bent. The sensing technique of IllumiWear is not only able to discriminate between discreet touch, slight bends, and harsh bends, but also recover the location of deformation. In this way, our computational fabric prototype uses its intrinsic means of visual output (light) as a tool for interactive input. We provide design and implementation details for our prototype as well as a technical evaluation of its effectiveness and limitations as an interactive computational textile. In addition, we examine the potential of this prototype's interactive capabilities by extending our eTextile to create a tangible user interface for audio and visual manipulation.}

Through the presented investigation of previous visualizations, it becomes apparent that the existing visuals in this class of system, generally relate to the interpolation model that determines the weightings of the presets and not the sonic output. The Star Interpolator looks to resolve this deficiency by providing visual cues that relate to the parameter space. Through comparative exploration it has been found this visualization provides a number of benefits over the previous systems. It is also shown that hybrid visualization can be generated that combined benefits of the new visualization with the existing interpolation models. These can then be accessed by using an Interactive Visualization (IV) approach. The results from our exploration of these visualizations are encouraging and they appear to be advantageous when using the interpolators for sound designs tasks. Therefore, it is proposed that formal usability testing is undertaken to measure the potential value of this form of visualization.}

Performers explore the plate model via tactile interaction through a Sensel Morph interface, chosen to allow damping and localised striking consistent with playing hand percussion.  Through an iteration of prototypes, we have designed an embedded proto-instrument that allows a bodily interaction between the performer and the virtual-acoustic plate in a way that redirects from the perception of the Sensel as a touchpad and reframes it as a percussive surface. Due to the computational effort required to run such a rich physical model and the necessity to provide a natural interaction, the audio processing is implemented on a high powered single board computer. We describe the design challenges and report on the technological solutions we have found in the implementation of Vodhrán which we believe are valuable to the wider NIME community.}

This paper explores the potential of building sound synthesisers with BCIs that are based on steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP).

It presents a new concept called sonic expression, that is to express oneself purely by the synthesis of sound. It introduces new layouts and designs for BCI-based sound synthesisers and the limitations of these interfaces are discussed. An evaluation of different sound synthesis techniques is conducted to find an appropriate one for such systems. Synthesis techniques are evaluated and compared based on a framework governed by sonic expression.}

The tempo, melody, and timbral features of the generated music are modulated according to biosensor input from each runner using a wearable Bluetooth sensor. We compare the relative performance of athletes listening to heart-rate and cadence synchronous music, across a randomized trial (N=57) on a trail course with 76ft of elevation. Participants were instructed to continue until perceived effort went beyond an 18 using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. We found that cadence-synchronous music improved performance and decreased perceived effort in male runners, and improved performance but not perceived effort in female runners, in comparison to heart-rate synchronous music. This work has implications for the future design and implementation of novel portable music systems and in music-assisted coaching.}

Towards enhanced usability of these descriptor-based frameworks for the music community, the paper advances a minimal content-based audio description scheme, rooted on primary musical notation attributes at the threefold sound object, meso and macro hierarchies. Multiple perceptually-guided viewpoints from rhythmic, harmonic, timbral and dynamic attributes define a discrete and finite alphabet with minimal formal and subjective assumptions using unsupervised and user-guided methods. The Factor Oracle automaton is then adopted to model and visualize temporal morphology. The generative musical applications enabled by the descriptor-based framework at multiple structural hierarchies are discussed.}

While a conventional cassette tape  player has a single tapehead, which rigidly placed, our instrument utilizes multiple handheld tapehead modules as an interface. Players can hold the interfaces and press them against the rotating magnetic tape at an any point to record or reproduce sounds The player can also easily erase and rewrite the sound recorded on the tape. With this instrument, they can achieve improvised and unique musical expressions through tangible and spatial interactions.

We achieved this by using an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor for detecting performer’s different emotional states and, based on these, sending midi messages for digital processing units automation. The aim is to create a new generation of digital processor units that could be automatically configured in real-time given the emotions or thoughts of the performer or the audience. By introducing emotional state information in the real time control of several aspects of artistic expression, we highlight the impact of surprise and uniqueness in the artistic performance.}

Describing the close and persistent interactions between organisms of different species, symbioses manifest across a spectrum of relationship types, each identified according to the health effect experienced by the engaged organisms. This biological taxonomy is appropriated within a framework which identifies specific modes of interaction between sound and movement according to the collaborating practitioners’ intended outcome, and required provisions, cognition of affect, and system operation. Using the symbiotic framework as an analytical tool, six dancer-musician collaborations from the field of NIME are examined in respect to the employed modes of interaction within each of the four examined areas. The findings reveal the emergence of multiple modes in each work, as well as examples of mutation between different modes over the course of a performance. Furthermore, the symbiotic concept provides a novel understanding of the ways gesture recognition technologies (GRTs) have redefined the relationship dynamics between dancers and musicians, and suggests a more efficient and inclusive approach in communicating the potential and limitations presented by Human-Computer Interaction tools.}

Olly was tested in the dance studio of a special education needs (SEN) school in North-East London, UK, for a period of 5 weeks, every Thursday afternoon for 30 minutes. Olly uses one Bare touch board in midi mode and four stretch analog sensors embedded inside four elastic ribbons. These ribbons top the main body of the installation which is made by using an inflatable gym ball wrapped in felt. Each of the ribbons plays a different instrument and triggers different harmonic chords. Olly allows to play pleasant melodies if interacting with it in solo mode and more complex harmonies when playing together with others. Results show great potentials for carefully designed musical TUI implementation aimed at scaffolding social play while affording self-regulation in SEN contexts. We present a brief introduction on the background and motivations, design considerations and results.}

Thus, a new audience-centric musical genre has emerged, which aligns with artistic manifestations where there is an explicit inclusion of the public (e.g. participatory art, cinema or theatre). Previous research has focused on analysing this new genre from historical, social organisation and technical perspectives. This follow-up paper contributes with reflections on technical and aesthetic aspects of composing within this audience-centric approach. We propose a set of 13 composition dimensions that deal with the role of the performer, the role of the audience, the location of sound and the type of feedback, among others. From a reflective approach, four participatory pieces developed by the authors are analysed using the proposed dimensions. Finally, we discuss a set of recommendations and challenges for the composers-developers of this new and promising musical genre. This paper concludes discussing the implications of this research for the NIME community.}

  abstract = {This paper reflects on players' first responses to a constrained Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) in open, child-led sessions with seven children at a special school. Each player's gestures with the instrument were sketched, categorised and compared with those of others among the group. Additionally, sensor data from the instruments was recorded and analysed to give a secondary indication of playing style, based on note and silence durations. In accord with previous studies, the high degree of constraints led to a diverse range of playing styles, allowing each player to appropriate and explore the instruments within a short inaugural session. The open, undirected sessions also provided insights which could potentially direct future work based on each person's responses to the instruments. The paper closes with a short discussion of these diverse styles, and the potential role constrained ADMIs could serve as 'ice-breakers' in musical projects that seek to co-produce or co-design with neurodiverse children and young people.}

  abstract = {When performing with new instruments, musicians often develop new performative gestures and playing techniques. Music performance studies on new instruments often consider interfaces that feature a spectrum of gestures similar to already existing sound production techniques. This paper considers the choices performers make when creating an idiomatic gestural language for an entirely unfamiliar instrument. We designed a musical interface with a unique large-scale layout to encourage new performers to create fully original instrument-body interactions. We conducted a study where trained musicians were invited to perform one of two versions of the same instrument, each physically identical but with a different tone mapping. The study results reveal insights into how musicians develop novel performance gestures when encountering a new instrument characterised by an unfamiliar shape and size. Our discussion highlights the impact of an instrument’s scale and layout on the emergence of new gestural vocabularies and on the qualities of the music performed.}

The main goal of this study was to implement methods for learning and developing practice with these technological objects in order to generate future pedagogical methods. During the research period of six months, four participants regularly engaged in workshop-type scenarios where learning objectives were proposed and guided by themselves.The principal researcher, working as participant-observer, did not impose or prescribed learning objectives to the other members of the group. Rather, all participants had equal say in what was to be done and how it was to be accomplished. Results show that the group learning environment is rich in opportunities for learning, mutual teaching, and for establishing a comunal practice for a given interactive musical system.Key findings suggest that learning by demonstration, observation and modelling are significant for learning in this context. Additionally, it was observed that a dialogue and a continuous flow of information between the members of the community is needed in order to motivate and further their learning.}

Global statistics unpack underlying trends and design goals across the chronological period of the NIME conference. In recent years, we note a growing number of DMIs targeting non-experts and with reduced requirements in terms of expertise. Stemming from the identified trends, we discuss future challenges in the design of DMIs for education towards enhanced degrees of variation and unpredictability.}

  abstract = {The tabla is a traditional pitched two-piece Indian drum set, popular not only within South East Asian music, but whose sounds also regularly feature in western music. Yet tabla remains an aural tradition, taught largely through a guru system heavy in custom and mystique. Tablas can also pose problems for school and professional performance environments as they are physically bulky, fragile, and reactive to environmental factors such as damp and heat. As part of a broader project to demystify tabla, we present an electronic tabla that plays nearly identically to an acoustic tabla and was created in order to make the tabla acces- sible and practical for a wider audience of students, pro- fessional musicians and composers. Along with develop- ment of standardised tabla notation and instructional educational aides, the electronic tabla is designed to be compact, robust, easily tuned, and the electronic nature allows for scoring tabla through playing. Further, used as an interface, it allows the use of learned tabla technique to control other percussive sounds. We also discuss the technological approaches used to accurately capture the localized multi-touch rapid-fire strikes and damping that combine to make tabla such a captivating and virtuosic instrument.}

The instrument features a breath pressure sensor with a large dynamic range, a keyboard that allows for polyphonic pitch selection, and a completely integrated construction. Sound synthesis is performed with Faust code compiled to the Bela Mini, which offers low-latency audio and a simple yet powerful development workflow. In order to be as accessible and versatile as possible, the hardware and software is entirely open-source, and fabrication requires only common maker tools.}

Despite an abundance of techniques and systems little research has explored how these might be useful for end-users looking to compose with generative and algorithmic music techniques. User interfaces for generative music systems are often inaccessible to non-programmers and neglect established composition workflow and design paradigms that are familiar to computer-based music composers. We have developed a system called the Interactive Generative Music Environment (IGME) that attempts to bridge the gap between generative music and music sequencing software, through an easy to use score editing interface. This paper discusses a series of user studies in which users explore generative music composition with IGME. A questionnaire evaluates the user’s perception of interacting with generative music and from this provide recommendations for future generative music systems and interfaces.}

This paper presents a novel way of interaction with a modular synthesizer by exploring the affordances of cord-base UIs. A special patch cable was developed us- ing commercially available piezo-resistive rubber cords, and was adapted to fit to the 3.5 mm mono audio jack, making it compatible with the Eurorack modular-synth standard. Moreover, a module was developed to condition this stretch- able sensor/cable, to allow multiple Patch-cordes to be used in a given patch simultaneously. This paper also presents a vocabulary of interactions, labeled through various physical actions, turning the patch cable into an expressive controller that complements traditional patching techniques.}

This paper is dedicated to the sound installation “Soil choir v.1.3” that sonifies soil moisture in different depths and transforms this non-musical phenomenon into organized sound structures. The sonification of natural soil moisture processes tests the limits of our attention, patience and willingness to still perceive ultra-slow reactions and examines the mechanisms of our sense adaptation. Although the musical time of the installation is set to almost non-human – environmental time scale (changes happen within hours, days, weeks or even months…) this system can be explored and even played also as an instrument by putting sensors to different soil areas or pouring liquid into the soil and waiting for changes... The crucial aspect of the work was to design the sonification architecture that deals with extreme slow changes of input data – measured values from moisture sensors. The result is the sound installation consisting of three objects – each with different types of soil. Every object is compact, independent unit consisting of three low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensors, 1m long perspex tube filled with soil, full range loudspeaker and Bela platform with custom Supercollider code. I developed this installation during the year 2019 and this paper gives insight into the aspects and issues connected with creating this installation.}

The various different ways in which such design traits affects their performance are outlined, as are their overall consequence to the artistic outcome and to individual experiences of it. It is shown that, to a varying extent, they all embody, mediate, and aid actualise the specifics their parent projects revolve around. It is eventually suggested that in the context of an exploratory and hybrid artistic practice, bespoke instruments of sorts, their improvised performance, the material traits or processes they implement or pivot on, and the ideas/narratives that perturb thereof, may all intertwine and fuse into one another so that a clear distinction between one another is not always possible, or meaningful. In such a vein, this paper aims at being an account of such a practice upon which prospective researchers/artists may further build upon.}

Today,  however,  there  is  a  lack  of  improvisation culture in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not trained to improvise, or cannot find other people to improvise with.  Motivated by this observation,  we  develop BachDuet,  a  system  that  enables real-time counterpoint improvisation between a human anda machine.  This system uses a recurrent neural network toprocess the human musician’s monophonic performance ona MIDI keyboard and generates the machine’s monophonic performance in real time. We  develop a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction. We  conduct  user  studies  with  13  musically  trained users  and  show  the  feasibility  of  two-party  duet  counterpoint improvisation and the effectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose.  We also conduct listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the difference between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those generated by human-human improvisation.  Objective evaluation is also conducted to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint, showing promising results.}

For the same reason however, they may hinder the audience experience, making the musician contribution and expressiveness difficult to perceive. In order to cope with this issue without altering the instruments, researchers and artists alike have designed techniques to augment their performances with additional information, through audio, haptic or visual modalities. These techniques have however only been designed to offer a fixed level of information, without taking into account the variety of spectators expertise and preferences. In this paper, we investigate the design, implementation and effect on audience experience of visual augmentations with controllable level of detail (LOD). We conduct a controlled experiment with 18 participants, including novices and experts. Our results show contrasts in the impact of LOD on experience and comprehension for experts and novices, and highlight the diversity of usage of visual augmentations by spectators.}

The results show that a maximum message rate of 2300 Hz is possible on a 2.4 GHz network for a single embedded device and decreases as the number of devices are added. During testing it was possible to have up to 7 devices transmitting at 100 Hz while attaining less than 10 ms latency, but performance degrades with increasing sending rates and number of devices. Performance can also vary significantly from day to day depending on network usage in a crowded environment.}

  abstract = {Advanced musical cooperation, such as concurrent control of musical parameters or sharing data between instruments,has  previously  been  investigated  using  multi-user  instruments  or  orchestras  of  identical  instruments.   In  the  case of heterogeneous digital orchestras, where the instruments, interfaces, and control gestures can be very different, a number of issues may impede such collaboration opportunities. These include the  lack  of  a  standard  method  for  sharing data or control, the incompatibility of parameter types, and limited  awareness  of  other  musicians’  activity  and  instrument  structure.   As  a  result,  most  collaborations  remain limited to synchronising tempo or applying effects to audio outputs. In this paper we present two interfaces for real-time group collaboration amongst musicians with heterogeneous instruments.   We  conducted  a  qualitative  study  to  investigate how these interfaces impact musicians’ experience and their musical output, we performed a thematic analysis of inter-views,  and  we  analysed  logs  of  interactions.   From  these results  we  derive  principles  and  guidelines  for  the  design of advanced collaboration systems for heterogeneous digital orchestras, namely Adapting  (to)  the  System, Support  Development, Default  to  Openness, and Minimise  Friction to Support Expressivity.}

This applies particularly but not exclusively to the so-called group of people with physical and/or mental disabilities. This paper presents two Accessible Digital Musical Instruments (ADMIs) that were specifically designed for the students of a Special Educational Needs (SEN) school with a focus on intellectual disabilities. With SnoeSky, we present an ADMI in the form of an interactive starry sky that integrates into the Snoezel-Room. Here, users can 'play' with 'melodic constellations' using a flashlight. SonicDive is an interactive installation that enables users to explore a complex water soundscape through their movement inside a ball pool. The underlying goal of both ADMIs was the promotion of self-efficacy experiences while stimulating the users' relaxation and activation. This paper reports on the design process involving the users and their environment. In addition, it describes some details of the technical implementaion of the ADMIs as well as first indices for their effectiveness.}

The system automatically assigns IDs to performers/users as they enter the tracking area, but when occlusion of a performer occurs, or when a user exits and then re-enters the tracking area, upon rediscovery of the user the system generates a new tracking ID. Because of this any assigned and registered target tracking points for specific users are lost, as are the linked abilities of that performer to control media based on their movements. We describe a single camera system for overcoming this problem by assigning IDs based on the colours worn by the performers, and then using the colour tracking for updating and confirming identification when the performer reappears after occlusion or upon re-entry. A video link is supplied showing the system used for an interactive dance work with four dancers controlling individual audio tracks. }

The recent revival of analog modular synthesizers explores novel possibilities of sounds based on unconventional technologies such as integrating biological forms and structures into traditional circuits. A biosignal has been used in experimental music as the material for composition. However, the recent development of a biocomputor using a slime mold biomemristor expands the use of biomemristors in music. Based on prior research, characteristics of Aloe vera as a biomemristor were electrically measured, and two types of analog synthesizer modules were developed, current to voltage converter and current spike to voltage converter. For this application, a live performance was conducted with the CVC module and the possibilities as a new interface for musical expression were examined.}

By contrast, subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments. First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.}

  abstract = {In NIME design, thorough attention has been devoted to feedback modalities, including auditory, visual and haptic feedback. How the performer executes the gestures to achieve a sound on an instrument, by contrast, appears to be less examined. Previous research showed that auditory imagery, or the ability to hear or recreate sounds in the mind even when no audible sound is present, is essential to the sensorimotor control involved in playing an instrument. In this paper, we enquire whether auditory imagery can also help to support skill transfer between musical instruments resulting in possible implications for new instrument design. To answer this question, we performed two experimental studies on pitch accuracy and fluency where professional violinists were asked to play a modified violin. Results showed altered or even possibly irrelevant auditory feedback on a modified violin does not appear to be a significant impediment to performance. However, performers need to have coherent imagery of what they want to do, and the sonic outcome needs to be coupled to the motor program to achieve it. This finding shows that the design lens should be shifted from a direct feedback model of instrumental playing toward a model where imagery guides the playing process. This result is in agreement with recent research on skilled sensorimotor control that highlights the value of feedforward anticipation in embodied musical performance. It is also of primary importance for the design of new instruments: new sounds that cannot easily be imagined and that are not coupled to a motor program are not likely to be easily performed on the instrument.}

This idea builds upon the notion of graphic scores and composed instrument, and apply them in a new context. Our proposal also explores possible parallels between open meaning in interaction design, and aleatoric score, conceptualized as Open Work by the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco. Our approach has two aims. The first aim is to create an environment where users can immerse themselves in the visual elements of a score while listening to the corresponding music. The second aim is to facilitate users to develop a personal relationship with both the system and the score. To achieve those aims, as a practical implementation of our proposed concept, we developed two immersive scenarios: a 360º video and an interactive space. We conclude presenting how our design aims were accomplished in the two scenarios, and describing positive and negative elements of our implementations.}

The textile quality of the fine steel wire-mesh evokes a haptic familiarity inherent to textile materials.  This makes it easy for the audience to overcome the initial threshold barrier to get in touch with the artwork in an exhibition situation. Additionally, the interaction is not dependent on visuals. The characteristics of the surface sensor allows a user to play the instrument without actually touching it.}

In an objective test of dynamic range, we find that our implementation provides wider and more consistent dynamic range response in comparison with solenoid-based robotic percussionists.

A playful pedagogical approach based on practice-based methods is presented and evaluated. My goal was introducing the art of NIME design and performance giving less emphasis to technology. Instead of letting technology determine how we teach and think during the class, I propose fostering at first the student's active construction and understanding of the field experimenting with physical materials,sound production and bodily movements. For this intention I developed a few classroom exercises which my students had to study and practice. During this period of five years, 95 students attended the course. At the end of the semester course, each student designed, built and performed a new interface for musical expression in front of an audience. Thus, in this paper I describe and discuss the benefits of applying playfulness and practice-based methods for teaching NIME in art universities. I introduce the methods and classroom exercises developed and finally I present some lessons learned from this pedagogical experience.}

With this work, we start a systematic exploration of this relatively uncharted research area, by means of (1) briefly reviewing existing musical interfaces that capitalize on deformable input,and (2) surveying 11 among experts and pioneers in the field about their experience with and vision on non-rigid musical interfaces.Based on experts’ input, we suggest possible next steps of musical appropriation with deformable and shape-changing technologies.We conclude by discussing how cross-overs between NIME and HCI research will benefit non-rigid interfaces.}

We present a brief history at the intersection of VR and the laptop orchestra. We then present the design of the piece and distill it into a set of design principles. Broadly, these design principles address the interplay between the different conflicting perspectives at play: those of the VR performer, the ensemble, and the audience. For example, one principle suggests that the perceptual link between the physical and virtual world maybe enhanced for the audience by improving the performers' sense of embodiment. We argue that these design principles are a form of generalized knowledge about how we might design laptop orchestra pieces involving virtual reality.}

  abstract = {So far, NIME research has been mostly inward-looking, dedicated to divulging and studying our own work and having limited engagement with trends outside our community. Though musical instruments as cultural artefacts are inherently political, we have so far not sufficiently engaged with confronting these themes in our own research. In this paper we argue that we should consider how our work is also political, and begin to develop a clear political agenda that includes social, ethical, and cultural considerations through which to consider not only our own musical instruments, but also those not created by us. Failing to do so would result in an unintentional but tacit acceptance and support of such ideologies. We explore one item to be included in this political agenda: the recent trend in music technology of ``democratising music'', which carries implicit political ideologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with a number of recommendations for stimulating community-wide discussion on these themes in the hope that this leads to the development of an outward-facing perspective that fully engages with political topics.}

  abstract = {We present TRAVIS II, an augmented acoustic violin with touch sensors integrated into its 3D printed fingerboard that track left-hand finger gestures in real time. The fingerboard has four strips of conductive PLA filament which produce an electric signal when fingers press down on each string. While these sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can be removed from the augmented instrument, maintaining the aesthetics of a traditional violin. Our design allows violinists to naturally create music for interactive performance and improvisation without requiring new instrumental techniques. In this paper, we describe the design of the instrument, experiments leading to the sensing fingerboard, and performative applications of the instrument.}

  abstract = {The expressive control of sound and music through body movements is well-studied.  For some people, body movement is demanding, and although they would prefer to express themselves freely using gestural control, they are unable to use such interfaces without difficulty.  In this paper, we present the P(l)aying Attention framework for manipulating recorded music to support these people, and to help the therapists that work with them. The aim is to facilitate body awareness, exploration, and expressivity by allowing the manipulation of a pre-recorded ‘ensemble’ through an interpretation of body movement, provided by a machine-learning system trained on physiotherapist assessments and movement data from people with chronic pain.  The system considers the nature of a person’s movement (e.g. protective) and offers an interpretation in terms of the joint-groups that are playing a major role in the determination at that point in the movement, and to which attention should perhaps be given (or the opposite at the user’s discretion).  Using music to convey the interpretation offers informational (through movement sonification) and creative (through manipulating the ensemble by movement) possibilities.  The approach offers the opportunity to explore movement and music at multiple timescales and under varying musical aesthetics.}

The Deaf and Hard of Hearing cannot experience the sound in the same way. Instead, they are able to physically experience the vibrations, nuances, contours, as well as its correspondence with the hand gestures. Those who are not hard of hearing can experience the sound, but also feel it just the same, with the knowledge that the same physical vibrations are shared by everyone. The employment of sign language adds another aesthetic dimension to the instrument --a nuanced borrowing of a functional communication medium for an artistic end.  }

We developed a digital content that integrated these functionalities and enabled composition and live performance through manipulation of spheroids.}

In order to get an overview of existing and desired usages, we launched an on-line survey that collected 37 answers from practicioners in and outside of academic and design communities. In the survey we inquired about the participants' devices, their strengths and weaknesses, the layout of control dimensions, the used gestures and mappings, the synthesis software or hardware and the use of audio descriptors and machine learning. The results can inform the design of future interfaces, gesture analysis and mapping, and give directions for the need and use of machine learning for user adaptation.}

  abstract = {General-Purpose GPU computing is becoming an increasingly viable option for acceleration, including in the audio domain. Although it can improve performance, the intrinsic nature of a device like the GPU involves data transfers and execution commands which requires time to complete. Therefore, there is an understandable caution concerning the overhead involved with using the GPU for audio computation. This paper aims to clarify the limitations by presenting a performance benchmarking suite. The benchmarks utilize OpenCL and CUDA across various tests to highlight the considerations and limitations of processing audio in the GPU environment. The benchmarking suite has been used to gather a collection of results across various hardware. Salient results have been reviewed in order to highlight the benefits and limitations of the GPU for digital audio. The results in this work show that the minimal GPU overhead fits into the real-time audio requirements provided the buffer size is selected carefully. The baseline overhead is shown to be roughly 0.1ms, depending on the GPU. This means buffer sizes 8 and above are completed within the allocated time frame. Results from more demanding tests, involving physical modelling synthesis, demonstrated a balance was needed between meeting the sample rate and keeping within limits for latency and jitter. Buffer sizes from 1 to 16 failed to sustain the sample rate whilst buffer sizes 512 to 32768 exceeded either latency or jitter limits. Buffer sizes in between these ranges, such as 256, satisfied the sample rate, latency and jitter requirements chosen for this paper.}

We will give technical details of the Ambulation system we developed as part of the creation of the piece, and conclude with a collection of observations that emerged from the project. The research around the development and presentation of Ambulation contributes to the idea of field recording as a live, procedural practice, moving away from the ideas of the movement of documentary material from one place to another.

In this study, we contribute Interactive Rainbow Score, an interactive visual system to boost the learning of sight-playing, the general musical skill to read music and map the visual representations to performance motions. The key design of Interactive Rainbow Score is to associate pitches (and the corresponding motions) with colored notation and further strengthen such association via real-time interactions. Quantitative results show that the interactive feature on average increases the learning efficiency by 31.1%. Further analysis indicates that it is critical to apply the interaction in the early period of learning.}

We therefore propose a set of relevant dimensions, which are based both on categories proposed in recent works in the research context, and on original contributions. We then proceed to demonstrate its applicability by selecting a set of relevant case studies, and analyzing a sample set of ADMIs found in the literature.}

The second is based on interpolation between presets represented by polygons on screen and is called holistic. Participants had to listen to, memorize, and search for sound presets characterized by four parameters. Ten different configurations of sound synthesis and processing were presented to each participant, once for each approach. The performance scores of 28 participants (not including early testers) were computed using two measured values: the search duration, and the parametric distance between the reference and answered presets. Compared to the analytic sliders-based interface, the holistic interpolation-based interface demonstrated a significant performance improvement for 60% of sound synthesizers. The other 40% led to equivalent results for the analytic and holistic interfaces. Using sliders, expert users performed nearly as well as they did with interpolation. Beginners and intermediate users struggled more with sliders, while the interpolation allowed them to get quite close to experts’ results.}

The VR sequencer deals with chance-based operations to select audio clips for playback and spatial orientation-based rhythm and melody generation, while incorporating three-dimensional (3-D) objects as omnidirectional playheads. Spheres which grow from a variable minimum size to a variable maximum size at a variable speed, constantly looping, represent the passage of time in this VR sequencer. The 3-D assets which represent samples are actually sample containers that come in six common dice shapes. As the dice come into contact with a sphere, their samples are triggered to play. This behavior mimics digital audio workstation (DAW) playheads reading MIDI left-to-right in popular professional and consumer software sequencers. To incorporate height into VR music making, the VR sequencer is capable of generating terrain at the press of a button. Each terrain will gradually change, creating the possibility for the dice to roll on their own. Audio effects are built in to each scene and mapped to terrain parameters, creating another opportunity for chance operations in the music making process. The chance-based sample selection, spatial orientation-defined rhythms, and variable terrain mapped to audio effects lead to indeterminacy in performance and replication of a single piece of music. This project aims to give the gaming community access to experimental music making by means of consumer virtual reality hardware.}

Using Sonami’s current practice as a case study, this paper explores the utility, opportunities, and challenges involved in using ML in practice over many years. This paper also reports the perspective of Rebecca Fiebrink, the creator of the Wekinator ML tool used by Sonami, revealing how her work with Sonami has led to changes to the software and to her teaching. This paper thus contributes a deeper understanding of the value of ML for NIME practitioners, and it can inform design considerations for future ML toolkits as well as NIME pedagogy. Further, it provides new perspectives on familiar NIME conversations about mapping strategies, expressivity, and control, informed by a dedicated practice over many years.}

  abstract = {This paper details technologies and artistic approaches to crowd-driven music, discussed in the context of a live public installation in which activity in a public space (a busy railway platform) is used to drive the automated composition and performance of music. The approach presented uses realtime machine vision applied to a live video feed of a scene, from which detected objects and people are fed into Manhattan (Nash, 2014), a digital music notation that integrates sequencing and programming to support the live creation of complex musical works that combine static, algorithmic, and interactive elements. The paper discusses the technical details of the system and artistic development of specific musical works, introducing novel techniques for mapping chaotic systems to musical expression and exploring issues of agency, aesthetic, accessibility and adaptability relating to composing interactive music for crowds and public spaces. In particular, performances as part of an installation for BBC Music Day 2018 are described. The paper subsequently details a practical workshop, delivered digitally, exploring the development of interactive performances in which the audience or general public actively or passively control live generation of a musical piece. Exercises support discussions on technical, aesthetic, and ontological issues arising from the identification and mapping of structure, order, and meaning in non-musical domains to analogous concepts in musical expression. Materials for the workshop are available freely with the Manhattan software.}

This is considered as a tool for sound designers who could, for example, enter dialogue from a film script and generate appropriate back- ground music. The synthesizer uses emotional valence and arousal as a common representation between words and mu- sic. It draws on previous studies that relate words and mu- sical features to valence and arousal. The synthesizer was evaluated with a user study. Participants listened to music generated by the synthesizer, and described the music with words. The arousal of the words they entered was highly correlated with the intended arousal of the music. The same was, surprisingly, not true for valence. The synthesizer is online, at [redacted URL].}

First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second, the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern in a wider activity of making.}

To increase affordability and portability of force-feedback implementations in DMI design, we designed our platform to be wireless, self-contained and built from commercially available components. To provide examples of modularity and portability, we integrated TorqueTuner into a standalone haptic knob and into an existing DMI, the T-Stick. We implemented 3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider. While the original goal was to simulate the haptic feedback associated with turning a knob, we found that the platform allows for further expanding interaction possibilities in application scenarios where rotary control is familiar.}

However, one of the greatest challenges in mechatronic music is to enable these robots to deliver a nuanced and expressive performance. This depends on their capability to integrate dynamics, articulation, and a variety of ornamental techniques while playing a given musical passage. In this paper we introduce a robot arm pitch shifter for a mechatronic monochord prototype. This is a fast, precise, and mechanically quiet system that enables sliding techniques during musical performance. We discuss the design and construction process, as well as the system's advantages and restrictions. We also review the quantitative evaluation process used to assess if the instrument meets the design requirements. This process reveals how the pitch shifter outperforms existing configurations, and potential areas of improvement for future work.}

The AirSticks, although fully-functioning, were used as props in live performances in order to evaluate potential mapping strategies that were later implemented for real. This use of mime when designing Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) can help overcome choice paralysis, break from established habits, and liberate creators to realise more meaningful parameter mappings. Bringing this process into an interactive performance environment acknowledges the audience as stakeholders in the design of these instruments, and also leads us to reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions made by an audience when engaging with the performance of such ‘magical’ devices. This paper establishes two opposing strategies to parameter mapping, ‘movement-first’ mapping, and the less conventional ‘sound-first’ mapping that incorporates mime. We discuss the performance ‘One Five Nine’, its transformation from a partial mime into a fully interactive presentation, and the influence this process has had on the outcome of the performance and the AirSticks as a whole.}

By integrating control mechanisms for graphics inside VCV Rack, the music-making metaphors used to build a patch are extended into the visual domain. Users familiar with modular synthesizers are immediately able to start building high-fidelity graphics using the same control voltages regularly used to compose sound. Without needing to interact with two separate development environments, languages or metaphorical domains, users are encouraged to freely, creatively and enjoyably construct their own highly-integrated audio-visual instruments. This demonstration will showcase the construction of an audio-visual patch using URack, focusing on the integration of flexible GPU particle systems present in Unity with the vast library of creative audio composition modules inside VCV.}

In this paper, we present the Al-terity, a non-rigid musical instrument that comprises a deep learning model with generative adversarial network  architecture and use it for generating audio samples for real-time audio synthesis. The particular deep learning model we use for this instrument was trained with existing data set as input for purposes of further experimentation. The main benefits of the model used are the ability to produce the realistic range of timbre of the trained data set and the ability to generate new audio samples in real-time, in the moment of playing, with the characteristics of sounds that the performer ever heard before.   We argue that these advanced intelligence features on the audio synthesis level could allow us to explore performing music with particular response features that define the instrument's digital idiomaticity and allow us reinvent the instrument in the act of music performance.}

  abstract = {Feedback instruments offer radical new ways of engaging with instrument design and musicianship. They are defined by recurrent circulation of signals through the instrument, which give the instrument ‘a life of its own’ and a 'stimulating uncontrollability'.  Arguably, the most interesting musical behaviour in these instruments happens when their dynamic complexity is maximised, without falling into saturating feedback. It is often challenging to keep the instrument in this zone; this research looks at algorithmic ways to manage the behaviour of feedback loops in order to make feedback instruments more playable and musical; to expand and maintain the `sweet spot'. We propose a solution that manages gain dynamics based on measurement of complexity, using a realtime implementation of the Effort to Compress algorithm. The system was evaluated with four musicians, each of whom have different variations of string-based feedback instruments, following an autobiographical design approach.  Qualitative feedback was gathered, showing that the system was successful in modifying the behaviour of these instruments to allow easier access to edge transition zones, sometimes at the expense of losing some of the more compelling dynamics of the instruments. The basic efficacy of the system is evidenced by descriptive audio analysis. This paper is accompanied by a dataset of sounds collected during the study, and the open source software that was written to support the research.}

  abstract = {Brain-computer interfacing (BCI) offers novel methods to facilitate participation in audio engineering, providing access for individuals who might otherwise be unable to take part (either due to lack of training, or physical disability).  This paper describes the development of a BCI system for conscious, or ‘active’, control of parameters on an audio mixer by generation of synchronous MIDI Machine Control messages. The mapping between neurophysiological cues and audio parameter must be intuitive for a neophyte audience (i.e., one without prior training or the physical skills developed by professional audio engineers when working with tactile interfaces). The prototype is dubbed MINDMIX (a portmanteau of ‘mind’ and ‘mixer’), combining discrete and many-to-many mappings of audio mixer parameters and BCI control signals measured via Electronecephalograph (EEG). In future, specific evaluation of discrete mappings would be useful for iterative system design.}

An elastic rubber membrane forms the playing surface of the instrument, while machine learning is used for dimensionality reduction and gesture recognition. The membrane is stretched over a hollow shell which permits considerable depth excursion, with an array of distance sensors tracking the surface displacement from underneath. The inherent dynamics of the membrane lead to cross-coupling between nearby sensors, however we do not see this as a flaw or limitation. Instead we find this coupling gives structure to the playing techniques and mapping schemes chosen by the user. The instrument is best utilized as a tool for actively designing abstraction and forming a relative control structure within a given system, one which allows for intuitive gestural control beyond what can be accomplished with conventional musical controllers.}

Differences were found in primary target user groups of digital platforms in the UK and China as well as the stages of the culture creation cycle they were developed for. Reasons for the divergence of digital platforms include differences in culture, regulation, and infrastructure, as well as the inherent Western bias of software for music making such as Digital Audio Workstations. Using AI to bridge between Western and Chinese music traditions is suggested as an opportunity to address aspects of the divergent landscape of digital platforms for music inside and outside China.}

Projects Mobius I and Mobius II illustrate two potential directions toward a musical interface, one focusing on the circular form, and the other, on graphical ornaments of pottery. Six conductive graphics on the pottery function as capacitive sensors while retaining their resemblance to traditional ornamental patterns in pottery. Offering pottery as a musical interface, we invite users to orchestrate algorithmic music by physically touching the different graphics.}

Grounded in five concepts from the theoretical literature on force dynamics in musical cognition, the paper presents a set of principles for interaction design focused on five force schemas: Path restraint, Containment restraint, Counter-force, Attraction, and Compulsion. We describe an initial set of examples that implement these principles using a Leap Motion sensor for gesture tracking and SuperCollider for interactive audio design. Finally, the paper presents a pilot experiment that provides initial ratings of intuitiveness in the user experience.}

In this paper, creative uses of time as a parameter in continuous controller mapping are demonstrated: the speed of movement affects the position mapping and control output. A set of SuperCollider classes are presented, developed in the author’s practice in computer music, where they have been used together with commercial MIDI controllers. The creative applications employ various approaches and metaphors for scaling time, but also machine learning for recognising patterns. In the techniques, performer, controller and synthesis ‘intra-act’, to use Karen Barad’s term: because position and velocity are derived from the same data, sound output cannot be predicted without the temporal context of performance.}

On the one hand, we aim to determine action-based perceptual invariants that allow us to establish pertinent relations between gesture qualities and sound features. On the other hand, we are interested in analysing how an interactive model-based sonification can provide useful and effective feedback for dance practitioners. From this point of view, our research explicitly addresses the convergence between the scientific understandings provided by the field of movement sonification and the traditional know-how developed over the years within the digital instrument and interaction design communities. A key component of our study is the combination between physically-based sound synthesis and motion features analysis. This approach has proven effective in providing interesting insights for devising novel sonification models for artistic and scientific purposes, and for developing a collaborative platform involving the designer, the musician and the performer.}

We hypothesized that a music beginner cannot determine tonal pitches of melody over a particular chord but can use body movements to specify the pitch contour (i.e., melodic outline) and the attack timings (i.e., rhythm). We aim to realize a performance interface for supporting expressing intuitive pitch contour and attack timings using body motion and outputting harmonious pitches over the chord progression of the background music. Since the intended users of this system are not limited to people with music experience, we plan to develop a system that uses Android smartphones, which many people have. Our system consists of three modules: a module for specifying attack timing using smartphone sensors, module for estimating the vertical movement of the smartphone using smartphone sensors, and module for estimating the sound height using smartphone vertical movement and background chord progression. Each estimation module is developed using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is often used to estimate time series data. We conduct evaluation experiments for each module. As a result, the attack timing estimation had zero misjudgments, and the mean error time of the estimated attack timing was smaller than the sensor-acquisition interval. The accuracy of the vertical motion estimation was 64%, and that of the pitch estimation was 7.6%. The results indicate that the attack timing is accurate enough, but the vertical motion estimation and the pitch estimation need to be improved for actual use.}

  abstract = {Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology, enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument in-progress.}

We describe the artistic rationale for our artwork, the design of the two interaction schemes, and the technical and usability feedback that we have obtained from demonstrations during iterative development.

The possibility to use sensors for providing an input for sound processing/synthesis units let composers and sound artist open up new ways for experimentation. Augmented Reality, by rendering virtual objects in the real world and by making those objects interactive (via some sensor-generated input), provides a new frame for this research field. In fact, the 3D visual feedback, delivering a precise indication of the spatial configuration/function of each virtual interface, can make the instrumental augmentation process more intuitive for the interpreter and more resourceful for a composer/creator: interfaces can change their behavior over time, can be reshaped, activated or deactivated. Each of these modifications can be made obvious to the performer by using strategies of visual feedback. In addition, it is possible to accurately sample space and to map it with differentiated functions. Augmenting interfaces can also be considered a visual expressive tool for the audience and designed accordingly: the performer’s point of view (or another point of view provided by an external camera) can be mirrored to a projector. This article will show some example of different designs of AR piano augmentation from the composition Studi sulla realtà nuova.}

This paper embodies the more recent acknowledgement of the importance of practice-based methods of evaluation [1,2,3,4] concerning the use of NIMEs within performance and the recognition that it is only within the situation of practice that the context is available to actually interpret and evaluate the instrument [2]. Within this context this paper revisits the Feral Cello performance system that was first presented at NIME 2017 [5]. This paper explores what has been learned through the artistic practice of performing and workshopping in this context by drawing heavily on the experiences of the performer/composer who has become an integral part of this project and co-author of this paper. The original philosophical context is also revisited and reflections are made on the tensions between this position and the need to ‘get something to work’. The authors feel the presentation of the semi-structured interview within the paper is the best method of staying truthful to Hayes understanding of musical improvisation as an enactive framework ‘in its ability to demonstrate the importance of participatory, relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and processes’ [4].}

In particular, in jazz improvisation, one of the major barriers is the mastery and appropriate selection of scales from a wide range, according to harmonic context and style. In this paper, we present AutoScale, an interactive software for making jazz improvisation more accessible by lifting the burden of scale selection from the musician while still allowing full controllability if desired. This is realized by implementing a MIDI effect that dynamically maps the desired scales onto a standardized layout. Scale selection can be pre-programmed, automated based on algorithmic lead sheet analysis, or interactively adapted. We discuss the music-theoretical foundations underlying our approach, the design choices taken for building an intuitive user interface, and provide implementations as VST plugin and web applications for use with a Launchpad or traditional MIDI keyboard.}

  abstract = {Nearly two decades after its inception as a workshop at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, NIME exists as an established international conference significantly distinct from its precursor. While this origin story is often noted, the implications of NIME's history as emerging from a field predominantly dealing with human-computer interaction have rarely been discussed. In this paper we highlight many of the recent—and some not so recent—challenges that have been brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of the neoliberal university—which have underpinned academia's drive for innovation—and the quantification and economisation of research performance which have facilitated certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies, we suggest that critical reflection and moreover mediation is necessary in order to address burgeoning concerns which have been raised within the NIME discourse in relation to methodological approaches,'diversity and inclusion', 'accessibility', and the fostering of rigorous interdisciplinary research.}

  abstract = {Digital musical instrument design is often presented as an open-ended creative process in which technology is adopted and adapted to serve the musical will of the designer. The real-time music programming languages powering many new instruments often provide access to audio manipulation at a low level, theoretically allowing the creation of any sonic structure from primitive operations. As a result, designers may assume that these seemingly omnipotent tools are pliable vehicles for the expression of musical ideas. We present the outcomes of a compositional game in which sound designers were invited to create simple instruments using common sensors and the Pure Data programming language. We report on the patterns and structures that often emerged during the exercise, arguing that designers respond strongly to suggestions offered by the tools they use. We discuss the idea that current music programming languages may be as culturally loaded as the communities of practice that produce and use them. Instrument making is then best viewed as a protracted negotiation between designer and tools.}

  abstract = {Percussive fingerstyle is a playing technique adopted by many contemporary acoustic guitarists, and it has grown substantially in popularity over the last decade. Its foundations lie in the use of the guitar's body for percussive lines, and in the extended range given by the novel use of altered tunings. There are very few formal accounts of percussive fingerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview study to investigate its approach to composition, performance and musical experimentation. Our aim was to gain insight into the technique from a gesture-based point of view, observe whether modern fingerstyle shares similarities to the approaches in NIME practice and investigate possible avenues for guitar augmentations inspired by the percussive technique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the transcribed interviews: our findings highlight the participants' material-based approach to musical interaction and we present a three-zone model of the most common percussive gestures on the guitar's body. Furthermore, we examine current trends in Digital Musical Instruments, especially in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible future directions in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees' perspectives.}

  abstract = {In the field of human computer interaction (HCI) the limitations of prototypes as the primary artefact used in research are being realised. Prototypes often remain open in their design, are partially-finished, and have a focus on a specific aspect of interaction. Previous authors have proposed `research products' as a specific category of artefact distinct from both research prototypes and commercial products. The characteristics of research products are their holistic completeness as a design artefact, their situatedness in a specific cultural context, and the fact that they are evaluated for what they are, not what they will become. This paper discusses the ways in which many instruments created within the context of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), including those that are used in performances, often fall into the category of prototype. We shall discuss why research products might be a useful framing for NIME research. Research products shall be weighed up against some of the main themes of NIME research: technological innovation; musical expression; instrumentality. We conclude this paper with a case study of Strummi, a digital musical instrument which we frame as research product.}

The ad hoc and temporary pop-up space is seen as formative in shaping the outcomes of the work. Through the lens of curated research, working together with a provocative brief, we explored handmade objects, craft, non-craft, human error, and the spirit of DIY, DIYness. We used the Studio Bench - a method that brings making, recording and performance together in one space - and viewed workshopping and performance as a holistic event. A range of methodologies were investigated in relation to NIME. These included the Hardware Mash-up, Speculative Sound Circuits and Reverse Design, from product to prototype, resulting in the instrument the Radical Nails. Finally, our work drew on the notion of design as performance and making in public and further developed our understanding of workshop-installation and performance-installation.}

Digital musical interfaces based on the voice have typically used indirect control, in which features extracted from audio signals control the parameters of sound generation, for example in audio to MIDI controllers. By contrast, focusing on the musculature of the singing voice allows direct muscular control, or alternatively, combined direct and indirect control in an augmented vocal instrument. In this way we aim to both preserve the intimate relationship a vocalist has with their instrument and key timbral and stylistic characteristics of the voice while expanding its sonic capabilities. This paper discusses other digital instruments which effectively utilise a combination of indirect and direct control as well as a history of controllers involving the voice. Subsequently, a new method of direct control from physiological aspects of singing through sEMG and its capabilities are discussed. Future developments of the system are further outlined along with usage in performance studies, interactive live vocal performance, and educational and practice tools.}

This work outlines the implementation of one such application in the form of an assistance tool designed for live improvisational performances by laptop ensembles. The primary intention was to leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained NN models as a basis for assisting individual performers either as musical novices looking to engage with more experienced performers or as a tool to expand musical possibilities through new forms of creative expression. The system expands upon a variety of ideas found in different research areas including new interfaces for musical expression, generative music and group performance to produce a networked performance solution served via a web-browser interface. The final implementation of the system offers performers a mixture of high and low-level controls to influence the shape of sequences of notes output by locally run NN models in real time, also allowing performers to define their level of engagement with the assisting generative models. Two test performances were played, with the system shown to feasibly support four performers over a four minute piece while producing musically cohesive and engaging music. Iterations on the design of the system exposed technical constraints on the use of a JavaScript environment for generative models in a live music context, largely derived from inescapable processing overheads.}

We first describe the system, controlled by the performer’s arms through Inertial Measuring Units and Electromyography sensors. The produced data is analyzed and used through mapping strategies as input of the sound synthesis engine. We conducted user studies to refine the sound synthesis engine, the choice of gestures and the mappings between them, and to finally evaluate this proof of concept. Indeed, the users approached the system with their own awareness ranging from the manipulation of abstract sound to the direct simulation of atmospheric phenomena - in the latter case, it could even be to revive memories or to create novel situations. This suggests that the approach of instrumentalization of sounds of known source may be a fruitful strategy for constructing expressive interactive sonic systems.}

These are used to investigate muscle contraction, which is again used as the basis for the sonic interaction design. Using a practice-based approach, the aim is to explore the musical aesthetics of naturally occurring bioelectric signals. We are particularly interested in exploring the differences between processing at audio rate versus control rate, and how the level of detail in the signal–and the complexity of the mappings–influence the experience of control in the instrument. This is exemplified through reflections on four concerts in which RAW has been used in different types of collective improvisation.}

Since this app was designed to be a tool for scale practice, drone-like accompaniment was chosen so that musicians could experiment with combinations of melody and harmony. The details of the application development process are discussed in this paper, with the main focus on scale analysis and harmonic transposition. By using these two components, the application is able to dynamically alter key to reflect the user's playing. As well as the design and implementation details, this paper reports and examines feedback from a small user study of undergraduate music students who used the app. }

Not every digital musical instrument seeks to create a close relationship between body and instrument, but even for the many that do, the design process often focuses heavily on technical and sonic factors, with relatively less attention to the bodily experience of the performer. In this paper we propose Somaesthetic design as an alternative to explore this space. The Soma method aims to attune the sensibilities of designers, as well as their experience of their body, and make use of these notions as a resource for creative design. We then report on a series of workshops exploring the relationship between the body and the guitar with a Soma design approach. The workshops resulted in a series of guitar-related artefacts and NIMEs that emerged from the somatic exploration of balance and tension during guitar performance. Lastly we present lessons learned from our research that could inform future Soma-based musical instrument design, and how NIME research may also inform Soma design.}

To interrogate these questions we undertook a survey in October 2019, gaining 117 responses. The survey collected statistical information on the use of pre-packaged and self-written music AI software. Respondents reported a range of musical outputs including producing recordings, live performance and generative work across many genres of music making. The survey also gauged general attitudes towards AI in music and provided an open field for general comments. The responses to the survey suggested a forward-looking attitude to music AI with participants often pointing to the future potential of AI tools, rather than present utility. Optimism was partially related to programming skill with those with more experience showing higher skepticism towards the current state and future potential of AI.}

In doing so, it breaks from the linear representational conventions of European Art music and modern Digital Audio Workstations. A user specifies time points on different layers, each of which corresponds to a particular sound. The layers are superimposed on a single circle, which allows a unique visual perspective on the relationships between musical voices given their geometric positions. Positions in-between quantizations are possible, which encourages experimentation with expressive timing and machine rhythms. User-selected transformations affect groups of notes, layers, and the pattern as a whole. Past and future states are also represented, synthesizing linear and cyclical notions of time. This paper will contemplate philosophical questions raised by circular rhythmic notation and will reflect on the ways in which the representational novelties and editing functions of Cycle have inspired creativity in musical composition.}

Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music. While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples of popular music and how the organism's non-linear behaviour can be controlled while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster processing and performance. }

  abstract = {This paper investigates how the concept of score has been used in the NIME community. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review of the NIME proceedings, analyzing papers in which scores play a central role. We analyzed the score not as an object per se but in relation to the users and the interactive system(s). In other words, we primarily looked at the role that scores play in the performance ecology. For this reason, to analyze the papers, we relied on ARCAA, a recent framework created to investigate artifact ecologies in computer music performances. Using the framework, we created a scheme for each paper and clustered the papers according to similarities. Our analysis produced five main categories that we present and discuss in relation to literature about musical scores.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the development of MapLooper: a live-looping system for gesture-to-sound mappings. We first reviewed loop-based Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). We then developed a connectivity infrastructure for wireless embedded musical instruments with distributed mapping and synchronization. We evaluated our infrastructure in the context of the real-time constraints of music performance. We measured a round-trip latency of 4.81 ms when mapping signals at 100 Hz with embedded libmapper and an average inter-onset delay of 3.03 ms for synchronizing with Ableton Link. On top of this infrastructure, we developed MapLooper: a live-looping tool with 2 example musical applications: a harp synthesizer with SuperCollider and embedded source-filter synthesis with FAUST on ESP32. Our system is based on a novel approach to mapping, extrapolating from using FIR and IIR filters on gestural data to using delay-lines as part of the mapping of DMIs. Our system features rhythmic time quantization and a flexible loop manipulation system for creative musical exploration. We open-source all of our components.}

This paper focuses on evaluations conducted in the last four years of NIME (2017 to 2020), compares results to previous research, and classifies evaluation types to describe how researchers approach and study UX in NIME. While results of this review confirm patterns such as the prominence of short-term, performer perspective evaluations, and the variety of evaluation strategies used, they also show that UX-focused evaluations are typically exploratory and limited to novice performers. Overall, these patterns indicate that current UX evaluation strategies do not address dynamic factors such as skill development, the evolution of the performer-instrument relationship, and hedonic and cognitive aspects of UX. To address such limitations, we discuss a number of less common tools developed within and outside of NIME that focus on dynamic aspects of UX, potentially leading to more informative and meaningful evaluation insights.}

In its acoustic mode, the interface is identical to the regular six-hole recorder. In its electronic mode, the interface detects the player's fingering and breath velocity and translates them to MIDI messages. Specifically, it maps higher breath velocity to higher octaves, with the modulo remainder controlling the microtonal pitch bend. This novel mapping reproduces a highly realistic flute-playing experience. Furthermore, changing the parameters easily augments the interface into a hyperinstrument that allows the player to control microtones more expressively via breathing techniques.}

The produced tones retain the identifiable timbres of the ambient sounds. Tones generated using input sounds from various environments, such as sea waves, leaves rustle and traffic noise, are analyzed. A configuration for a live in-situ performance is described, consisting of live streaming the produced sounds. In this configuration, the environment itself acts as a ‘performer’ of sorts, alongside the Aeolis player, providing both real-time input signals and complementary visual cues.}

After having run a large study for understanding a listener’s spontaneous rendering of form and movement, we built a number of digital instruments especially designed to emphasise a particular energy-motion profile. The evaluation through composition and performance indicates that this design paradigm can foster musical inventiveness and expression in the processes of composition and performance of gestural electronic music.}

A quartet of performers tested the Global Hyperorgan’s capacities for telematic musicking through a series of pieces. The concept of modularity is useful when considering the artistic challenges and possibilities of the Global Hyperorgan. We observe how the modular system utilized in the pilot study afforded multiple experiences of shared instrumentality from which new, synthetic voices emerge.

The ability for replication contributes to an instrument’s longevity and creates opportunities for both DMI designers and researchers. Research papers often omit necessary knowledge for replicating research artefacts, but we argue that mitigating this situation is not just about including design materials and documentation. Our way of approaching this issue is by drawing on an age-old method as a way of disseminating knowledge, the apprenticeship. We propose the DMI apprenticeship as a way of exploring the procedural obstacles of replicating DMIs, while highlighting for both apprentice and designer the elements of knowledge that are a challenge to communicate in conventional documentation. Our own engagement with the DMI apprenticeship led to successfully replicating an instrument, Strummi. Framing this process as an apprenticeship highlighted the non-obvious areas of the documentation and manufacturing process that are crucial in the successful replication of a DMI.}

We show that NIME design using principles from soma design can offer creative opportunities in developing novel sensing mechanisms, which can in turn inform composition and further elicit curious engagements between performer and artefact, disrupting notions of performer-led control. As contributions, this work 1) offers an example of NIME design for situated living, feeling, performing bodies, and 2) presents the rich potential of soma design as a path for designing in this context.}

  abstract = {This paper presents the design and preliminary evaluation of an Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) in the form of a tangible wooden step sequencer that uses photoresistors and wooden blocks to trigger musical events. Furthermore, the paper presents a short overview of design criteria for ADMIs based on literature and first insights of an ongoing qualitative interview study with German Special Educational Needs (SEN) teachers conducted by the first author. The preliminary evaluation is realized by a reflection on the mentioned criteria. The instrument was designed as a starting point for a participatory design process in music education settings. The software is programmed in Pure Data and running on a Raspberry Pi computer that fits inside the body of the instrument. While most similar developments focus on professional performance and complex interactions, LoopBlocks focuses on accessibility and Special Educational Needs settings. The main goal is to reduce the cognitive load needed to play music by providing a clear and constrained interaction, thus reducing intellectual and technical barriers to active music making.}

We also consider several criteria that distinguish the two groups' evaluation strategies. We conclude with important discussion of the mapping designer's perspective, performance with gestural controllers, and the difficulties of evaluating mapping designs and musical instruments in general.}

We explore this NIME topic in the context of building the first iteration of an augmented acoustic guitar prototype for percussive fingerstyle guitarists. The first author, himself a percussive fingerstyle player, started the project of an augmented guitar with expectations and assumptions made around his own playing style, and in particular around the arrangement of one song. This input was complemented by the outcome of an interview study, in which percussive guitarists highlighted functional and creative requirements to suit their needs. We ran a pilot study to assess the resulting prototype, involving two other players. We present their feedback on two configurations of the prototype, one equalising the signal of surface sensors and the other based on sample triggering. The equalisation-based setting was better received, however both participants provided useful suggestions to improve the sample-triggering model following their own auditory imagery.}

Hundreds of generations are evaluated using blind-listening tests to determine the extent to which the aspects of rhythm we understand to be valuable are learnt and reproduced. Our model is able to achieve a standard of rhythmic production comparable to human playing across arbitrarily long time periods and multiple playing styles.}

They then applied design fiction methods towards imagining several speculative instruments of the future. Each stage of the workshop revealed very specific utopian ideas surrounding the design of sound instruments. After introducing the background and methods of the workshop, the authors present an overview and thematic analysis of the workshop's outcomes. The paper concludes with some reflections on the use of this method-in-progress for investigating the ethics and affordances of historical electronic sound instruments. It also suggests the significance of ethics and affordances for the design of contemporary instruments.}

Most efforts to work with these modalities together tend to either treat haptics as secondary to audio, or conversely, audio as secondary to haptics, and design sensations in each modality separately. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of designing audio and vibrotactile effects simultaneously by interpolating audio-haptic control spaces. An inverse radial basis function method is used to dynamically create a mapping from a two-dimensional space to a many-dimensional control space for multimodal effects based on user-specified control points. Two proofs of concept were developed focusing on modifying the same structure across modalities and parallel structures.}

Within the same network, the players can use their smartphone as the controller by entering a specific URL into their smartphone’s browser. After joining the network, by actuating the smartphone's accelerometer, the players apply gravitational force to a swarm of particles in the virtual space. Machine learning-based gesture pattern recognition is parallelly used to increase the functionality of the gestural command. Through this interface, the player can achieve intuitive control of gravitation in virtual reality (VR) space. The gravitation becomes the medium of the system involving physics, graphics, and sonification which composes a multimodal compositional language with cross-modal correspondence. Entangled is built on AlloLib, which is a cross-platform suite of C++ components for building interactive multimedia tools and applications. Throughout the script, the reason for each decision is elaborated arguing the importance of crossmodal correspondence in the design procedure.}

  abstract = {We present Spire Muse, a co-creative musical agent that engages in different kinds of interactive behaviors. The software utilizes corpora of solo instrumental performances encoded as self-organized maps and outputs slices of the corpora as concatenated, remodeled audio sequences. Transitions between behaviors can be automated, and the interface enables the negotiation of these transitions through feedback buttons that signal approval, force reversions to previous behaviors, or request change. Musical responses are embedded in a pre-trained latent space, emergent in the interaction, and influenced through the weighting of rhythmic, spectral, harmonic, and melodic features. The training and run-time modules utilize a modified version of the MASOM agent architecture. Our model stimulates spontaneous creativity and reduces the need for the user to sustain analytical mind frames, thereby optimizing flow. The agent traverses a system autonomy axis ranging from reactive to proactive, which includes the behaviors of shadowing, mirroring, and coupling. A fourth behavior—negotiation—is emergent from the interface between agent and user. The synergy of corpora, interactive modes, and influences induces musical responses along a musical similarity axis from converging to diverging. We share preliminary observations from experiments with the agent and discuss design challenges and future prospects.}

Seamless transition from the smooth but rigid, often uncommunicative sound of the harmoniser to a more noisy, open and chaotic sound world required the addition of extra features and scenarios. This prepares the instrument for multiple musical environments, including free improvised settings with large sonic diversity. The system should particularly interest virtuoso improvising electroacoustic musicians and hyperinstrument player/developers that combine many musical styles in their art and that look for inspiration to use existing virtuosity for electronic control.}

We refer to this context-dependent decisions as situated musical actions. Here, we present directions for designing a customisable virtual companion to help live coders in their practice. In particular, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model that, based on a set of examples provided by the live coder, filters the crowdsourced sounds retrieved from the Freesound online database at performance time. We evaluated a first illustrative model using objective and subjective measures. We tested a more generic live coding framework in two performances and two workshops, where several ML models have been trained and used. We discuss the promising results for ML in education, live coding practices and the design of future NIMEs.}

Using low latency, high fidelity WebRTC, our system allows guests to mix themselves in, remix the raw nature streams, or run our multichannel sources fully through their own processors. Created in early 2020 in response to the locked down conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the site became a virtual oasis, with usage data showing long duration visits. In collaboration with several festivals that went online in 2020, programmed live content included music, storytelling, and guided meditation. One festival commissioned a local microphone installation, resulting in a second nature source for the station: 5-channels of sound from a small Maine island. Catalyzed by recent events, when many have been separated from environments of inspiration and restoration, we propose Living Sounds as both a virtual nature space for cohabitation and a new kind of contingent online venue.}

"Sound animation" in this context means musical performance based on various modes of replay and transformation of all kinds of recorded music samples. Sound animation using Mono-Replay is a two-step process, including an off-line analysis phase and on-line performance or synthesis phase. The analysis phase proceeds with time segmentation, and the set up of anchor points corresponding to temporal musical discourse parameters (notes, pulses, events). This allows, at the performance phase, for control of timing, playback position, playback speed, and a variety of spectral effects, with the help of gesture interfaces. Animation principles and software features of Mono-Replay are described. Two examples of sound animation based on beat tracking and transient detection algorithms are presented (a multi-track record of Superstition by Steve Wonder and Jeff Beck and Accidents/Harmoniques, an electroacoustic piece by Bernard Parmegiani). With the help of these two contrasted examples, the fundamental principles of “sound animation” are reviewed: parameters of musical discourse, audio file segmentation, gestural control and interaction for animation at the performance stage.}

Signal processing is used to recognize gestures and other events, which we map to a variety of musical parameters to demonstrate possible applications. We have developed Quadrant as an open-hardware circuit board, which acts as a USB controller to a host computer.}

  abstract = {This short article presents a reductionist infra-instrument. It concerns a yellow die-cast aluminium box only featuring a key switch and a 1/4” TRS balanced audio output as its UI. On the turn of the key, the device performs a certain poem in Morse code and via very low frequency acoustic pulses; in this way, it transforms poetry into bursts of intense acoustic energy that may resonate a hosting architecture and any human bodies therein. It is argued that the instrument functions at the very same time as a critical/speculative electronic object, as an ad-hoc performance instrument, and as a piece of (conceptual) art on its own sake.}

  abstract = {Wireless sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly accessible and widely explored in interactive musical performance due to their ubiquity and low-cost, which brings the necessity of understanding the capabilities and limitations of these sensors. This is usually approached by using a reference system, such as an optical motion capture system, to assess the signals’ properties. However, this process raises the issue of synchronizing the signal and the reference data streams, as each sensor is subject to different latency, time drift, reference clocks and initialization timings. This paper presents an empirical quantification of the latency communication stages in a setup consisting of a Qualisys optical motion capture (mocap) system and a wireless microcontroller-based sensor device. We performed event-to-end tests on the critical components of the hybrid setup to determine the synchronization suitability. Overall, further synchronization is viable because of the near individual average latencies of around 25ms for both the mocap system and the wireless sensor interface.}

The HASGS system was intended to retain focus on the performance of the acoustic instrument, keeping gestures centralised within the habitual practice of the instrument, and reducing the use of external devices to control electronic parameters in mixed music. Taking a reduced approach, the technology chosen to prototype HASGS was developed in order to serve the aesthetic intentions of the pieces being written for it. This strategy proved to avoid an overload of solutions that could bring artefacts and superficial use of the augmentation processes, which sometimes occur on augmented instruments, specially prototyped for improvisational intentionality. Here, we discuss how the repertoire, hardware, and software of the system can be mutually affected by this approach. We understand this project as an empirically-based study which can both serve as a model for analysis, as well provide composers and performers with pathways and creative strategies for the development of augmentation processes.}

In particular, the size and position of the interface components of Immersive Virtual Musical Instruments (IVMIs) can be freely chosen to elicit large or small hand gestures. In addition, VR allows for the manipulation of what users visually perceive of their actual physical actions, through redirections and changes in Control-Display Ratio (CDR). Visual and gestural amplitudes can therefore be defined separately, potentially affecting the user experience in new ways. In this paper, we investigate the use of CDR to enrich the design with a control over the user perceived fatigue, sense of presence and musical expression. Our findings suggest that the CDR has an impact on the sense of presence, on the perceived difficulty of controlling the sound and on the distance covered by the hand. From these results, we derive a set of insights and guidelines for the design of IVMIs.}

The triple pendulum is a simple physical system constructed by attaching three pendulums vertically such that each joint can swing freely. When subjected to large oscillations, its motion is chaotic and is often described as unexpectedly mesmerizing. Le Bâton uses wireless inertial measurement units (IMUs) embedded in each pendulum arm to send real-time motion data to Max/MSP. Additionally, we implemented a control mechanism, allowing a user to remotely interact with it by setting the initial release angle. Here, we explain the motivation and design of Le Bâton and describe mapping strategies. To conclude, we discuss how its nature of user interaction complicates its status as a digital musical instrument.}

In controlled laboratory experiments, electrodermal activity (EDA) has been traditionally used to measure fluctuations of musical emotion. EDA is, however, ill-suited for real-world settings (e.g., live concerts) because of its sensitivity to movement, electronic noise and variations in the contact between the skin and the recording electrodes. The CHILLER, based on the Raspberry Pi architecture, overcomes these limitations by using a well-known algorithm capable of detecting goosebumps from a video recording of a patch of skin. The CHILLER has potential applications in both academia and industry and could be used as a tool to broaden participation in STEM, as it brings together concepts from experimental psychology, neuroscience, physiology and computer science in an inexpensive, do-it-yourself device well-suited for educational purposes.}

  abstract = {Creating an artificially intelligent (AI) aid for music composers requires a practical and modular approach, one that allows the composer to manipulate the technology when needed in the search for new sounds. Many existing approaches fail to capture the interest of composers as they are limited beyond their demonstrative purposes, allow for only minimal interaction from the composer or require GPU access to generate samples quickly. This paper introduces Score-Transformer (ST), a practical integration of deep learning technology to aid in the creation of new music which works seamlessly alongside any popular software notation (Finale, Sibelius, etc.). Score-Transformer is built upon a variant of the powerful transformer model, currently used in state-of-the-art natural language models. Owing to hierarchical and sequential similarities between music and language, the transformer model can learn to write polyphonic MIDI music based on any styles, genres, or composers it is trained upon. This paper briefly outlines how the model learns and later notates music based upon any prompt given to it from the user. Furthermore, ST can be updated at any time on additional MIDI recordings minimizing the risk of the software becoming outdated or impractical for continued use.}

Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method can facilitate human-AI co-creation of drum loops with diverse and customizable outputs. In the process, we argue for the interaction paradigm of mapping by demonstration as a promising approach to working with deep learning models that are capable of generating complex and realistic musical parts.}

We deliberately use low-tech and DIY approaches to build simple sound modules for music interaction and education in order to ensure accessibility of the technology. The modules are operated by wireless power transfer (WPT). A multichannel sound field can be easily generated and modulated by placing several sound objects in proximity to the induction coils. Alterations in sound are caused by repositioning, moving or grouping the sound modules. Although not physically linked to each other, the objects start interacting electro-acoustically when they share the same magnetic field. Because they are equipped with electronic sound generators and transducers, the sound modules can work independently from a sound studio situation.}

Music gives individuals another medium to communicate through, which is especially important for individuals with cognitive or physical disabilities. Teachers of children with severe disabilities have expressed a lack of musical instruments adapted for these children, which leads to an incomplete music education for this group. This study aims at designing and evaluating a set of collaborative musical instruments for children with cognitive and physical disabilities, and the research is done together with the special education school Rullen in Stockholm, Sweden. The process was divided into three main parts; a pre-study, building and designing, and finally a user study. Based on findings from previous research, together with input received from teachers at Rullen during the pre-study, the resulting design consists of four musical instruments that are connected to a central hub. The results show that the instruments functioned as intended and that the design makes musical learning accessible in a way traditional instruments do not, as well as creates a good basis for a collaborative musical experience. However, fully evaluating the effect of playing together requires more time for the children to get comfortable with the instruments and also for the experiment leaders to test different setups to optimize the conditions for a good interplay.}

To that end, we propose a taxonomy of interactions in sequencer-based music performances of electronic music. We identify two performance modes sequencing and sound design and four interaction classes creation, modification, selection, and evaluation. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of the different interaction classes on both, musicians as well as the audience and use the proposed taxonomy to analyze six commercially available hardware devices.}

Improvisation in music education is addressed within the perspective of an alternative but an increasingly influential enactive approach to mind (Varela et al., 1993) followed by the four theories known as the 4E of cognition - embedded, embodied, enactive and extended - which naturally have characteristics in common that led them to be grouped in this way. I discuss the “autopoietic” (self-maintain systems that auto-reproduce over time based on their own set of internal rules) nature of the embodied musical mind. To conclude, an overview concerning the enactivist approach within DMIs design in order to provide a better understanding of the experiences and benefits of using new technologies in musical learning contexts is outlined.}

However, a creator may know a good mapping when they encounter it yet start with little sense of what the inputs or outputs should be. We call this an open-ended mapping process. Addressing this need, we introduce the latent mapping, which leverages the latent space of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm such as a Variational Autoencoder trained on a corpus of unlabelled gestural data from the creator. We illustrate it with Sonified Body, a system mapping full-body movement to sound which we explore in a residency with three dancers.}

Since synchronization is one of the big challenges, or perhaps something to be avoided due to network latency, this work explicitly calls for desynchronization in a controlled way, using metronomes running at different rates to take performers in and out of approximate synchronization. A special editor was developed to visualize the music because conventional editors do not support multiple continuously varying tempi.}

In Bias, for bass clarinet and Interactive Music System, a computer music system using two Neural Networks trained to develop “aesthetic bias” interacts with the musician by evaluating the sound input based on its “subjective” aesthetic judgments. The composition problematizes the discrepancies between the concepts of error and accuracy, associated with supervised machine learning, and aesthetic judgments as inherently subjective and intangible. The methods used in the compositional process are discussed with respect to the objective of balancing the trade-off between musical authorship and interpretative freedom in interactive musical works.}

A fingerboard traversal system with a dynamic finger tip apparatus enables the robot to play gamakas - pitch based embellishments in-between notes, which are at the core of Carnatic music. A double roller design is used for bowing which reduces space, produces a tone that resembles the tone of a conventional violin bow, and facilitates super human playing techniques such as infinite bowing. The design also enables the user to change the bow hair tightness to help capture a variety of performing techniques in different musical styles. Objective assessments and subjective listening tests were conducted to evaluate our design, indicating that the robot can play gamakas in a realistic manner and thus, can perform Carnatic music.}

A clear case of what is meant by this, is the “stillness movement” of a body part, occurring despite the simultaneous explicit intention for that body part to remain still. In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, controlled experiment investigating this phenomenon along a vertical axis relative to the human fingertip. The results include characterizations of both the spatial distribution and frequency distribution of the stillness movement observed. Also included are results indicating a possible role for constant forces and viscosities in reducing stillness movement amplitude, thereby potentially enabling the implementation of more positional control of musical sound within the same available spatial range. Importantly, the above is summarized in a form that is directly interpretable for anyone designing technologies, interactions, or performances that involve fingertip control of musical sound. Also, a complete data set of the experimental results is included in the separate Appendices to this paper, again in a format that is directly interpretable.}

The theoretical underpinnings of this approach stem from observation and models of synchronization in living organisms, where synchronization and phase-locking is not only an observable phenomenon but can also be seen as a marker of the quality of interaction. Realized as a technical system of analogue oscillators synchronization also appears between oscillators tuned at different basic rhythm and stable polyrhythmic patterns emerge as the result of electrical connections.}

We use a practiced-based methodology informed by our skillset as percussionists to study how instrumental skills and sensibilities can be incorporated into the personalization of, and performance with, DMIs. We introduced a simple and adaptable digital musical instrument, built using the Arduino Uno, that individuals (percussionists) could personalize and extend in order to improvise, compose and create music (études). Our analysis maps parallel percussion practices emerging from the resultant DMI compositions and performances by examining the functionality of each Arduino instrument through the lens of material-oriented and communication-oriented approaches to interactivity.}

The performed calls from online visitors evolve using AI as they pass through the frog collective. After performing a rhythm, audiences listen ambisonically from behind a virtual veil and attempt to map the formation of the frogs, based on the spatial information embedded in their calls. After listening, audience members can reveal the frogs and their formation. By reconceiving rhumb lines—navigational tools that create paths of constant bearing to navigate space—as sonic tools to spatially orient listeners, RhumbLine: Plectrohyla Exquisita functions as a new interface for spatial musical expression (NISME) in both its physical and virtual instantiations.}

This paper proposes that NIME’s historical record is the best tool for understanding our own output but this record is incomplete, and makes the case for collective action to improve how we document our work. I begin by contrasting NIME’s output with its discourse, and explore the nature of this discourse through NIME history and examine our inherited epistemological complexity. I assert that, if left unexamined, this complexity can undermine our community values of diversity and inclusion. I argue that meaningfully addressing current problems demands critical reflection on our work, and explore how NIME’s historical record is currently used as a means of doing so. I then review what NIME's historical record contains (and what it does not), and evaluate its fitness for use as a tool of inquiry. Finally I make the case for collective action to establish better documentation practices, and suggest features that may be helpful for the process as well as the result.}

As an improvement, we developed the control interface structure with additional sensor hardware. In addition, we implemented a new hybrid deep learning architecture, GANSpaceSynth, in which we applied the GANSpace method on the GANSynth model. Following the deep learning model improvement, we developed new autonomous features for the instrument that aim at keeping the musician in an active and uncertain state of exploration. Through these new features, the instrument enables more accurate control on GAN latent space. Further, we intend to investigate the current developments through a musical composition that idiomatically reflects the new autonomous features of the AI-terity instrument. We argue that the present technology of AI is suitable for enabling alternative autonomous features in audio domain for the creative practices of musicians.}

Various approaches are considered for developing mapping strategies that create transparent metaphors to facilitate expression for both the performer and the audience. We explore strategies in the input, intermediate, and output mapping layers using a two-step approach guided by Perry’s Principles  [2]. First, we use trial-and-error to establish simple mappings between single input parameter control and effects to identify promising directions for further study. Then, we compose a specific piece that supports different uses of the BendShape mappings in a performance context: this allows us to study a performer trying different types of expressive techniques, enabling us to analyse the role each mapping has in facilitating musical expression. We also investigate the effects these mapping strategies have on performer bandwidth. Our main finding is that the high fidelity of the novel BendShape sensor facilitates creating interpretable input representations to control sound representations, and thereby match interpretations that provide better expressive mappings, such as with vocal shape to vocal sound and bumpiness control; however, direct mappings of individual, independent sensor mappings to effects does not provide obvious advantages over simpler controls. Furthermore, while the BendShape sensor enables rich explorations for sound, the ability to find expressive interpretable shape-to-sound representations while respecting the performer’s bandwidth limitations (caused by having many coupled input degrees of freedom) remains a challenge and an opportunity.}

Debris is built around the idea of looking at a sound not as a linear event to be played from beginning to end, but as a non-linear collection of moments, timbres, and sound fragments which can be explored, closely examined and interacted with. This paper positions the work among conceptually related NIME interfaces, details the various user interactions and their mappings and ends with a discussion around the interface’s constraints.}

  abstract = {Musical audio synthesis often requires systems-level knowledge and uniquely analytical approaches to music making, thus a number of machine learning systems have been proposed to replace traditional parameter spaces with more intuitive control spaces based on spatial arrangement of sonic qualities. Some prior evaluations of simplified control spaces have shown increased user efficacy via quantitative metrics in sound design tasks, and some indicate that simplification may lower barriers to entry to synthesis. However, the level and nature of the appeal of simplified interfaces to synthesists merits investigation, particularly in relation to the type of task, prior expertise, and aesthetic values. Toward addressing these unknowns, this work investigates user experience in a sample of 20 musicians with varying degrees of synthesis expertise, and uses a one-week, at-home, multi-task evaluation of a novel instrument presenting a simplified mode of control alongside the full parameter space. We find that our participants generally give primacy to parameter space and seek understanding of parameter-sound relationships, yet most do report finding some creative utility in timbre-space control for discovery of sounds, timbral transposition, and expressive modulations of parameters. Although we find some articulations of particular aesthetic values, relationships to user experience remain difficult to characterize generally.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces Tune Field, a 3-dimensional tangible interface that combines and alters previously existing concepts of topographical, field sensing and capacitive touch interfaces as a method for musical expression and sound visualization. Users are invited to create experimental sound textures while modifying the topography of antennas. The interface’s touch antennas are randomly located on a box promoting exploration and discovery of gesture-to-sound relationships. This way, the interface opens space to playfully producing sound and triggering visuals; thus, converting Tune Field into a sensorial experience.}

  abstract = {The basic role of DJs is creating a seamless sequence of music tracks. In order to make the DJ mix a single continuous audio stream, DJs control various audio effects on a DJ mixer system particularly in the transition region between one track and the next track and modify the audio signals in terms of volume, timbre, tempo, and other musical elements. There have been research efforts to imitate the DJ mixing techniques but they are mainly rule-based approaches based on domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the DJ mixer control from real-world DJ mixes toward a data-driven approach to imitate the DJ performance. Specifically, we estimate the mixing gain trajectories between the two tracks using sub-band analysis with constrained convex optimization. We evaluate the method by reconstructing the original tracks using the two source tracks and the gain estimate, and show that the proposed method outperforms the linear crossfading as a baseline and the single-band analysis. A listening test from the survey of 14 participants also confirms that our proposed method is superior among them.}

  abstract = {This paper reports on a project aimed to break away from the portability concerns of native DSP code between different platforms, thus freeing the instrument designer from the burden of porting new Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) to different architectures. Bespoke Anywhere is a live modular style software DMI with an instance of the Audio Anywhere (AA) framework, that enables working with audio plugins that are compiled once and run anywhere. At the heart of Audio Anywhere is an audio engine whose Digital Signal Processing (DSP) components are written in Faust and deployed with Web Assembly (Wasm). We demonstrate Bespoke Anywhere as a hosting application, for live performance, and music production. We focus on an instance of AA using Faust for DSP, that is statically complied to portable Wasm, and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) described in JSON, both of which are loaded dynamically into our modified version of Bespoke.}

  abstract = {Learning advanced skills on a musical instrument takes a range of physical and cognitive efforts. For instance, practicing polyrhythm is a complex task that requires the development of both musical and physical skills. This paper explores the use of automation in the context of learning advanced skills on the guitar. Our robotic guitar is capable of physically plucking on the strings along with a musician, providing both haptic and audio guidance to the musician. We hypothesize that a multimodal and first-person experience of “being able to play” could increase learning efficacy. We discuss the novel learning application and a user study, through which we illustrate the implication and potential issues in systems that provide temporary skills and in-situ multimodal guidance for learning.}
