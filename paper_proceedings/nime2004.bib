The interface emphasizes the looping nature of the music and is designed to be engaging and deployable on a wide range of interaction devices. Observations of the use of the tool with different levels of persistence of contribution are reported and discussed. Future developments centre around ways to string loops together into larger pieces (composition) and investigating suitable rates of decay to encourage more group improvisation.}

In a decentralized mechanical instrument, musical memory is an emergent global property of the system, undistinguishable from the execution process. Such a machine is botha score andan instrument. The paper starts by discussing the difference between sequential memory systems and systems exhibiting emergent decentralized musical behavior. Next, the use of particle system simulation for exploring virtual decentralized instruments is demonstrated, and the architecture for a simple decentralized instrument is outlined. The paper continues by describing the use of a genetic algorithm for evolving decentralized instruments that reproduce a given musical behavior.}

The program instructions are represented on printed paper disks directly as characters of English alphabet that could be read by human as effectively as they are picked up by the machine's optical cartridge. The result is a tangible interface that allows the user to manipulate pre-arranged musical material by hand, by adding together instrumental tracks to form a dynamic mix. A functional implementation of this interface is discussed in view of historical background and other examples of electronic instruments for music creation and performance incorporating optical turntable as a central element.}

The second one uses chroma-profile, that is, a radarchart representation of the frequency of pitch notations in the-piece. By making keys of the same chroma hot in reverse proportion to the value of the chroma-profile, it is possible to-constrain the performer's improvisation and to bring the tonality space close to a certain piece.}

  abstract = {The authors have developed several methods for spatially distributing spectral material in real-time using frequency-domain processing. Applying spectral spatialization techniques to more than two channels introduces a few obstacles, particularly with controllers, visualization and the manipulation of large amounts of control data. Various interfaces are presented which address these issues. We also discuss 3D “cube” controllers and visualizations, which go a long way in aiding usability. A range of implementations were realized, each with its own interface, automation, and output characteristics. We also explore a number of novel techniques. For example, a sound’s spectral components can be mapped in space based on its own components’ energy, or the energy of another signal’s components (a kind of spatial cross-synthesis). Finally, we address aesthetic concerns, such as perceptual and sonic coherency, which arise when sounds have been spectrally dissected and scattered across a multi-channel spatial field in 64, 128 or more spectral bands.}

Because of the fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. In this paper, we present a formalized framework for on-the-fly programming, based on the ChucK synthesis language, which supports a truly concurrent audio programming model with sample-synchronous timing, and a highly on-the-fly style of programming. We first provide a well-defined notion of on-thefly programming. We then address four fundamental issues that confront the on-the-fly programmer: timing, modularity, conciseness, and flexibility. Using the features and properties of ChucK, we show how it solves many of these issues. In this new model, we show that (1) concurrency provides natural modularity for on-the-fly programming, (2) the timing mechanism in ChucK guarantees on-the-fly precision and consistency, (3) the Chuck syntax improves conciseness, and (4) the overall system is a useful framework for exploring on-the-fly programming. Finally, we discuss the aesthetics of on-the-fly performance. }

Our instrument presents the performer with a large canvas where projected images can be grabbed and moved around with both hands simultaneously; the performer also has access to two video drums featuring haptic display to manipulate the shots and cut between streams.

This method offers a highly string-specific playability, as it is sensitive to the kinds of musical articulation produced by traditional playing techniques. Nuances of sound variation applied by the player will be present in the output signal even if those nuances are beyond traditionally measurable parameters like pitch, amplitude or brightness. The relatively minimal hardware requirements make the instrument accessible with little expenditure.}

My initial focus of investigation is the interaction between perceptions of auditory and visual beats. When the musical and graphical beats are completely synchronized with each other, as in a music video for promotional purposes, the audience feels that they are natural and comforting. My initial experiment has proved that the actual tempos of music and images are a little different. If a slight timelag exists between the musical and pictorial beats, the audience tries to keep them in synchronization by unconsciously changing the interpretation of the time-based beat points. As the lag increases over time, the audience seems to perceive that the beat synchronization has changed from being more downbeat to more upbeat, and continues enjoying it. I have developed an experiment system that can generateand control out-of-phase visual and auditory beats in real time, and have tested many subjects with it. This paper describes the measurement of time lags generated in the experiment system, as part of my psychological experiment.}

Since improvisation is the musical performance style that involves creating melodies while playing, it is not easy even for the people who can play musical instruments. However, previous studies have not dealt with improvisation support for the people who can play musical instruments but cannot improvise. In this study, to support such players' improvisation, we propose a novel improvisation supporting system called ism, which corrects musically unnatural melodies automatically. The main issue in realizing this system is how to detect notes to be corrected (i.e., musically unnatural or inappropriate). We propose a method for detecting notes to be corrected based on the N-gram model. This method first calculates N-gram probabilities of played notes, and then judges notes with low N-gram probabilities to be corrected. Experimental results show that the N-gram-based melody correction and the proposed system are useful for supporting improvisation.}

  abstract = {High capacity of transmission lines (Ethernet in particular) is much higher than what imposed by MIDI today. So it is possible to use capturing interfaces with high-speed and high-resolution, thanks to the OSC protocol, for musical synthesis (either in realtime or non real-time). These new interfaces offer many advantages, not only in the area of musical composition with use of sensors but also in live and interactive performances. In this manner, the processes of calibration and signal processing are delocalized on a personal computer and augments possibilities of processing. In this demo, we present two hardware interfaces developed in La kitchen with corresponding processing to achieve a high-resolution, high-speed sensor processing for musical applications. }

The aim of this paper is to develop such a system that enables nonprofessional people in our public spaces to play good contrapuntal music without any knowledge of music theory. The people are just walking. This system is based on the i-trace system [1] which can capture the people's behavior and give some visual feedback. }
