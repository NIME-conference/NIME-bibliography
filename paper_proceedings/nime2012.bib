  abstract = {A problem with many contemporary musical robotic percussion systems lies in the fact that solenoids fail to respond lin-early to linear increases in input velocity. This nonlinearity forces performers to individually tailor their compositions to specific robotic drummers. To address this problem, we introduce a method of pre-performance calibration using metaheuristic search techniques. A variety of such techniques are introduced and evaluated and the results of the optimized solenoid-based percussion systems are presented and compared with output from non-calibrated systems.}

The acoustic properties of the vibraphone allowed us to develop a very simple, low-cost and powerful amplification solution that requires no heat sinking. The physical design is meant to be portable and robust, and the system can be easily installed on any vibraphone without interfering with normal performance techniques. The system supports multiple in-terfacing solutions, affording the performer and composer the ability to interact with the EMvibe in different ways depending on the musical context.}

However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.}

The results of the analysis show core-categories such as familiarity with instrument and situation, shift of focus in activity, family of interactions and different categories of the experience emerging from the interviews. Our evaluation shows the suitability of our approach but also the need for iterating on our design on the basis of the perspectives brought forth by the users. This latter observation confirms the importance of conducting a thorough interview session followed by data analysis on the line of grounded theory.}

The interesting outcome of such an examination is that the actual instrument is the space of sound characteristics, through which the performer navigates with gestures captured by various input devices. We will take a look at different types of interaction modes and controllers (positional, inertial, audio analysis) and the gestures they afford, and provide a critical assessment of their musical and expressive capabilities, based on several years of musical experience, performing with the CataRT system for real-time CBCS.}

In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other's melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ''listening applications''.}

Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it, approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use --the XY pad and button grid --illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently being used to assess the validity of this approach.}

The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance.
The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.}

These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems.
The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.}

The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions.

This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors' Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and `site' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.}

Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.}

Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.}

We also propose and put in practice a design approach that considers the use of performance space as a way to engage with the audience. A collaborative project, Sound Gloves, presented here exemplifies such a concept by dissolving the space between performers and audience. Our approach resulted in a continuous interaction between audience and performers, in which the social dynamics was changed in a positive way in a live performance context of NIMEs. Such an approach, we argue, may be considered as one way to further engage and interact with the audience.}

Through vocal augmentation and modulation, the performers can easily generate desired amount of the vibrato and achieve wider vocal range. These vocal en-hancements will deliberately enrich the vocal performance both in its expressiveness and the dynamics. Using Voicon, singers can generate additional vibrato, control the pitch and activate customizable vocal effect by simple and intuitive gestures in live and recording context.}

The electronic chanter employs a robust and responsive infrared (IR) sensing strategy, and uses audio samples from acoustic recordings to produce a high quality bagpipe sound. Moreover, the continuous nature of the IR sensors offers the controller a considerable degree of flexibility, indicating sig-nificant potential for the inclusion of extended and novel techniques for musical expression in the future.}

The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can ``cut'' out their desired shapes, ``paste'' the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one's music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.}

The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor-mal workshops.}

In all three of these cases, detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured in real-time. We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a ``surrogate'' sensor. Some initial results comparing different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.}

Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant Instruments Anywhere, including using smartphone as the synthesis engine and power supply.}

In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities.
In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.}

MASD helps novice musicians in three ways. It removes the confusion that results from page turns, aides a musician's return to the proper location in the music score after the looking at the conductor and notifies musicians of conductor instructions. MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system.
There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.}

Thus all performances of the piece in his lifetime, and for decades after, were done with a single pianola or player piano.*
The author traces the origin of the concept of synchronizing multiple pianolas, and explains the attendant technological issues. He examines attempts to synchronize mechanical pianos and other time-based devices at the time of Ballet m{\'e}canique's composition, and suggests that Antheil's vision for his piece was not as farfetched as has long been thought.}

Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.}

Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction with this kind of interfaces, and in particular with the tangible tabletop instrument Reactable . In this paper we present a system based on a circular array of me-chanically intercoupled force sensing resistors used to obtain a low-latency, affordable, and easily embeddable hardware system able to detect surface impacts and pressures on the tabletop perimeter. We also consider the option of com-pleting this detected gestural information with the sound information coming from a contact microphone attached to the mechanical coupling layer, to control physical modelling synthesis of percussion instruments.}

Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration).
Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules [1]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow[2].
This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers [3].}

The scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully rehearsed and recorded using the Gest-O system.}

These voltages are used to control complex sound engines in an analogue modular synthesizer. Both the voltage field and the tap electrodes can be moved freely. The design was inspired by previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is cheap to build, and provides flexible control over a large set of parameters. It is musically satisfying to play, and allows for a wide range of playing techniques, from wild exploration to subtle expressions. I also present an inven-tory of the available playing techniques, motivated by the interface design, musically, conceptually and theatrically. The performance aspects of the interface are also discussed. The interface has been used in a number of performances in Sweden and Japan in 2011, and is also used by other musicians.}

  abstract = {The Electromagnetically Sustained Rhodes Piano is an orig-inal Rhodes Piano modified to provide control over the amplitude envelope of individual notes through aftertouch pressure. Although there are many opportunities to shape the amplitude envelope before loudspeaker amplification, they are all governed by the ever-decaying physical vibra-tions of the tone generating mechanism. A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011.
In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat-ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.}

Using this mapping layer, we conducted user studies comparing controlling the model muscle activations using a 2D set of force sensors with a position controlled kinematic input space that maps directly to the sound. Preliminary user evaluation suggests that it was more difficult to using force input but the resultant output sound was more intelligible and natural compared to the kinematic controller. This result shows that force input is a potentially feasible for browsing through a vowel space for an articulatory voice synthesis system, although further evaluation is required.}

A form of timbral matching is employed to form a link between the live performer and an expanding database of musical materials. In addition, the system takes into account the unique nature of the rehearsal/practice space in musical performance through the implementation of performer-configurable cumulative rehearsal databases into the final design. This paper discusses the system in detail with reference to related work in the field, making specific reference to the system's interactive potential both inside and outside of a real-time performance context.}

Online users control physical outputs on a custom-designed cabinet that reflects their activity through a combination of motorized knobs and LEDs, and streams the resultant audio. In a typical installation, a composer creates a complex physical patch on the modular synth that exposes a set of analog and digital parameters (knobs, buttons, toggles, and triggers) to the web-enabled cabinet. Both physically present and online audiences can control those parameters, simultane-ously seeing and hearing the results of each other's actions. By enabling collaborative interaction with a massive analog synthesizer, Patchwerk brings a broad audience closer to a rare and historically important instrument.

They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.}

By using NDEF, developers will have an eas-ier time managing nodes and their messages, especially for scenarios in which a single application or interface controls multiple sound engines.

AuRal is an environmental audio system in which individual participants form ad hoc ensembles based on geolocation and affect the overall sound of the music associated with the location that they are in.
The AuRal environment binds physical location and the choices of multiple, simultaneous performers to act as the generative force of music tied to the region. Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music. As a result, walking through the same location at different times results in unique collaborative listening experiences.}

Instead of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces' affordances, performers must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration, development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces, and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce sound. Our research seeks to overcome such obstacles by minimizing the code needed to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS and Android devices, our implementation extends the application Control to use a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output. On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single line of code. We believe the fluidity of our approach will encourage users to incorporate mobile devices into their everyday performance practice.}

As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.}

This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.}

Then, a central composing and conducting application running on a local interactive display, called Vuzik. Finally, a network protocol to synchronize the two. ChoirMob musicians can perform music together at any location where they can connect to a Vuzik central conducting device displaying a composed piece of music. We explored this system by creating a chamber choir of ChoirMob performers, consisting of both experienced musicians and novices, that performed in rehearsals and live concert scenarios with music composed using the Vuzik interface.}

The unique visual and audio geometries of the planetarium present challenges and opportunities. The game tessellates the dome in mobile, colored hexagons that emulate both atoms and musical scale intervals in an expanding universe. Spatial activity in the game maps to spatial locale and instrument voices in the speakers, in essence creating a virtual orchestra with a string section, percussion section, etc. on the dome. Future work includes distribution of game play via mobile devices to permit attendees to participate in a performance. This environment is open-ended, with great educational and aesthetic potential.}

The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.}

The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.}

Furthermore, it allows one to have an effective control over the sound, and consequently achieve great musical expression. In addition, a method for calibrating the multimedia digital instrument, devised to overcome the lack of a reliable reference point of the accelerometer and a process to obtain a video score are presented. This instrument has been used in a number of concerts (Portugal and Brazil) so as to test its robustness.}

A new approach creates a personalized on-screen slider that lets the user manipulate the audio in terms of a descriptive term (e.g. "warm"), without the user needing to learn or use the interface of an equalizer. This system learns mappings by presenting a sequence of sounds to the user and correlating the gain in each frequency band with the user's preference rating. The system speeds learning through transfer learning. Results on a study of 35 participants show how an effective, personalized audio manipulation tool can be automatically built after only three ratings from the user.}

The acoustic properties of these fitness balls are surprisingly rich, capable of producing subtle differences in timbre while being responsive over a wide dynamic range. The entire set has been purposefully designed to provide a player with the means to achieve a rigorous and healthy physical workout, in addition to the achieving beneficial cognitive and sensory stimulation that comes from playing music with a sensitive and expressive instrument.}

Driven by the interpersonal interactions amongst musicians, our system gives users, i.e., several musicians playing together in a band, real-time control over certain aspects of their performance, enabling them to change volume levels dynamically simply by moving around. It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical interfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, drawing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sciences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances traditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.}

  abstract = {Mapping between musical interfaces, and sound engines, is integral to the nature of an interface [3]. Traditionally, musical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor' to create a local coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer's small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces [1].}

The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it-self. This is done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo-cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.}
