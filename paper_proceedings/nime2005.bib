In contrast to hyper-, meta- and virtual instruments, we propose infra-instruments as devices of restricted interactive potential, with little sensor enhancement, which engender simple musics with scarce opportunity for conventional virtuosity. After presenting numerous examples from our work, we argue that it is precisely such interactionally and sonically challenged designs that leave requisite space for computer-generated augmentations in hybrid, multi-device performance settings.}

A central computer system analyzes MIDI and audio played by expert players and allows novice Beatbug players to personalize the analyzed material using a variety of transformation algorithms. This paper presents the motivation for developing the iltur system, followed by a brief survey of pervious and related work that guided the definition of the project’s goals.

Rhythm action games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video game and toy markets in record numbers.

In its current manifestation, control data is mapped to change the processing of the instrument's natural sound in Pd (Pure Data) [3]. SCUBA preserves the unity of the solo instrument interface by acoustically mixing direct and processed sound in the instrument's bell via mounted satellite speakers, which are driven by a subwoofer below the performer's chair.

The phenomenon of gyroscopic precessioncauses the instrument to slowly oscillate when it is spunquickly, providing the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel and tire and theresulting rotational inertia, it maintains a relatively constant angular velocity once it is set in motion. Various sensors were used to measure continuous and discrete quantitiessuch as the the angular frequency of the wheel, its spatialorientation, and the performer's finger pressure. In addition, optical and hall-effect sensors detect the passing of aspoke-mounted photodiode and two magnets. A base software layer was developed in Max/MSP and various patcheswere written with the goal of mapping the dynamic behaviorof the wheel to varied musical processes.}

Recently, several devices have been developed using alternatives to MIDI, including Ethernet-based and USB-based sensor interfaces. We have designed and produced a system that uses S/PDIF as the transport mechanism for a sensor interface. This provides robust performance, together with extremely low latency and high resolution. In our system, data from all sensors is multiplexed onto the digital audio line and demultiplexed in software on the computer using standard techniques. We have written demultiplexer objects and plugins for Max/MSP and Jade, as well as a MIDI Conversion program for interapplicaton uses, while others are in the works for PD, SuperCollider, and AudioUnits.}

In this paper I address this question drawing on my expe- rience in learning several very different types of sophisticated instruments: the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speech interface, the Digital Marionette controller for virtual 3D puppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary user of the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hours with Digital Marionette and Glove-Talk II, and thousands of hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue to work as a professional musician). I will identify some of the under- lying principles and approaches that I have observed during my learning and playing experience common to these instru- ments. While typical accounts of users learning new inter- faces generally focus on reporting beginner’s experiences, for various practical reasons, this is fundamentally different by focusing on the expert’s learning experience.}

WISEAR is both lightweight and wireless. Unlike several commercial alternatives, it is also a completely open source project.  PAIR (Partnering Analysis in Real Time) exploits the power of WISEAR and revisits the potential of hardware-based systems for real-time measurement of bodily movement. Our goal was to create a robust yet adaptable system that could attend to both general and precise aspects of performer interaction. Though certain commonalities with existing hardware systems exist, our PAIR system takes a fundamentally different approach by focusing specifically on the interaction of two or more dancers.}

Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about 10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally, similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320 Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.}

The integration of the three modalities offers completely innovative capacities for interaction. The objectives are scientific, cultural and educational. Finally, an additional objective was to test such a prototype system, including its haptic arm, in real conditions for general public and over a long duration in order to measure its solidity, its reliability and its interest for users. Thus, during the last three months of the project, a demonstrator was presented and evaluated in a museum in Paris, in the form of an interactive installation offering the public a musical game. Different from a video game, the aim is not to animate the pixels on the screen but to play music and to incite musical awareness.}

Assuming that a singing voice is a kind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singing voice are important for personification. We adopt a singing voice morphing algorithm that effectively smoothes out the strength of expressions delivered with a singing voice. The system’s hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bend sensors and two pressure sensors. It sensitively captures the user’s motion as a personified puppet’s gesture. To synthesize the different expressional strengths of a singing voice, the “normal” (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, “dark,” “whisper” and “wet,” are used as the target. This configuration provides musically expressed controls that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, we evaluate whether 1) the morphing algorithm interpolates expressional strength in a perceptual sense, 2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and 3) the gestural mapping of the current system works as planned.}

The results show that hitting the drum alternately from both sides with motion going through the drum plate was less accurate than the traditional one sided hitting. A physical stick was more accurate than a virtual computer graphic stick. Visual feedback of the drum slightly increased accuracy compared to receiving only auditory feedback. Most subjects evaluated the physical stick to offer a better feeling and to be more pleasant than the virtual stick. }

The paper discusses the process that replicates a Pure Data patch so that it will operate within the hardware and software constraints of the Java 2 Micro Edition. It also describes development of objects that will enable mobile phone performances to be simulated accurately in PD and to audition microtonal tuning implemented using MIDI in the j2me environment. These tools eliminate the need for composers to compose for mobile phones by writing java code. In a single desktop application, they offer the composer the flexibility to write music for multiple phones. }

With the advent of Internet communication, geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem: network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From a recent study, carried out by the authors, a relation between network latency tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment, in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs) project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system, including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay measured in real-time.}

In addition to real-time control over sound synthesis, we show how features such as dynamic patching, on-the-fly controller mapping, multiple control rates, and precisely-timed recording and playback of sensors can be employed under the ChucK programming model. Using this framework, composers, programmers, and performers can quickly write (and read/debug) complex controller/synthesis programs, and experiment with controller mapping on-the-fly. }

  abstract = {Discussion of time in interactive computer music systems engineering has been largely limited to data acquisition rates and latency.Since music is an inherently time-based medium, we believe thattime plays a more important role in both the usability and implementation of these systems. In this paper, we present a time designspace, which we use to expose some of the challenges of developing computer music systems with time-based interaction. Wedescribe and analyze the time-related issues we encountered whilstdesigning and building a series of interactive music exhibits thatfall into this design space. These issues often occur because ofthe varying and sometimes conflicting conceptual models of timein the three domains of user, application (music), and engineering.We present some of our latest work in conducting gesture interpretation and frameworks for digital audio, which attempt to analyzeand address these conflicts in temporal conceptual models.}

  abstract = {This paper reports our recent development on a reconfigurable user interface. We created a system that consists of a dial type controller ‘Spinner’, and the GUI (Graphical User Interface) objects for the Max/MSP environment[1]. One physical controller corresponds to one GUI controller on a PC’s display device, and a user can freely change the connection on the fly (i.e. associate the physical controller to another GUI controller). Since the user interface on the PC side is running on the Max/MSP environment that has high flexibility, a user can freely reconfigure the layout of GUI controllers. A single ‘Spinner’ control device consists of a rotary encoder with a push button to count rotations and a photo IC to detect specific patterns from the GUI objects to identify. Since ‘Spinner’ features a simple identification method, it is capable of being used with normal display devices like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and so on. A user can access multiple ‘Spinner’ devices simultaneously. By using this system, a user can build a reconfigurable user interface.}

Our initial starting point was that computer music software and the way their interfaces are built need not necessarily be limited to copying the acoustic musical instruments and studio technology that we already have, but additionally we can create unique languages and work processes for the virtual world. The computer is a vast creative space with specific qualities that can and should be explored. }

Work has been done by many artists and technologists in the intervening years to attempt to control music systems with brainwaves and --- indeed --- many other biological signals. Despite the richness of EEG, fMRI and other data which can be read from the human brain, there has up to now been only limited success in translating the complex encephalographic data into satisfactory musical results. We are currently pursuing research which we believe will lead to the possibility of direct brain-computer interfaces for rich and expressive musical control. This report will outline the directions of our current research and results. }

The driver'sdecisions affect in real-time the rendering of the piece. Thepedals and wheel provide a tactile interface for controlling thecar dynamics and musical expression, while the displayportrays a first person view of the road and dashboard from thedriver's seat. This game-like interface allows non-experts tocreate expressive renderings of existing music without havingto master an instrument, and allows expert musicians toexperiment with expressive choice without having to firstmaster the notes of the piece. The prototype system has beentested and refined in numerous demonstrations. This paperpresents the concepts underlying the ESP system and thearchitectural design and implementation of a prototype.}

The musical control is put into the hands of the subject, introducing an element of creativity and enhancing the sense of immersion. Information acquired with REMUPP can be output as numerical data for statistical analysis, but the tool is also suited for the use with more qualitatively oriented methods.}

  abstract = {INTRIUM is an interactive sound installation exploring the inside vibration of the atrium. A certain number of architectural elements are fitted with acoustic sensors in order to capture the vibration they produce when they are manipulated or touched by hands. This raw sound is further processed in real-time, allowing the participants to create a sonic landscape in the atrium, as the result of a collaborative and collective work between them.}

  abstract = {'Hop Step Junk' is an interactive sound installation that creates audio and visual representations of the audience's footsteps. The sound of a footstep is very expressive. Depending on one's weight, clothing and gate, a footstep can sound quite different. The period between steps defines one's personal rhythm. The sound output of 'Hop Step Junk' is wholly derived from the audience's footsteps. 'Hop Step Junk' creates a multi-generational playground, an instrument that an audience can easily play.}
