  abstract = {In this paper, the authors introduce an interactive device, ``POWDER BOX''for use by novices in musical sessions. ``POWDER BOX'' is equipped withsensor-based replaceable interfaces, which enable participants to discover andselect their favorite playing styles of musical instruments during a musicalsession. In addition, it has a wireless communication function thatsynchronizes musical scale and BPM between multiple devices. To date, various kinds of ``inventive'' electronic musical instruments havebeen created in the field of Computer Music field. The authors are interestedin formations of musical sessions, aiming for a balance between simpleinteraction and musical expression. This study focuses on the development ofperformance playing styles.Musicians occasionally change their playing styles (e.g., guitar pluckingstyle) during a musical session. Generally, it is difficult for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces. The authors expected thatchanging interfaces would bring similar effect as changing playing style by theskillful player. This research aims to establish an environment in whichnonmusicians and musicians share their individual musical ideas easily. Here,the interaction design and configuration of the ``POWDER BOX'' is presented.}

To supplement theseveral predefined gestures provided by the recognition system, personalizedgestures may be trained by the user. Upon successful recognition of a gesture,the corresponding audio effects are applied to the guitar signal and visualfeedback is provided to the user.

This collection is recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods, experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons. First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata --- some titles,track lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words, there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA), anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher'sunderstanding of the data.}

It does not provide a theoreticalframework within which we can analyze different scheduling protocols and theirimpact on the DMI's performance. Indeed, the mapping between the DMI's sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data flow can produceundesirable results, ranging from overflowing buffers that cause system crashesto misaligned sensory data that result in strange or disordered sonic events.In this paper, we attempt to remedy this problem by providing a framework forthe design and analysis of the DMI data flow.

The phases ofarticulation between two phonemes are continuously controlled and can bedriven in real time without noticeable delay, at any stage of the syntheticphoneme production. Thus, as in natural singing, very accurate rhythmicpatterns are produced and adapted while playing with other musicians. Theinstrument features two (augmented) pen tablets for controlling voiceproduction: one is dealing with the glottal source and vowels, the second oneis dealing with consonant/vowel articulation. The results show very naturalconsonant and vowel synthesis. Virtual choral practice confirms theeffectiveness of Digitartic as an expressive musical instrument.}

In aniterative design and fabrication process, several versions of this interfacewere build, tested and evaluated in performances. A detailed explanation of thedesign choices concerning the shape but also the sensing capabilities of theinstrument illustrates the emphasis on establishing an `enactive'instrumental relationship. A musical practice for this type of instrument isshown by discussing the methods used in the exploration of the gesturalpotential of the interface and the strategies deployed for the development ofmappings and compositions. Finally, to gain more information about how thisinstrument compares with similar designs, two dimension-space analyses are madethat show a clear positioning in relation to instruments that precede theQuarterstaff.}

At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point. Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained, allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results of experimentscomparing the users' pitch accuracy with and without the help of the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player.

The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom data series of di_x000B_erent orbits from an speci_x000C_c dynami-cal system. Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that result with a _x000C_xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci_x000C_c and independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements. The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate di_x000B_erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating those values from orbits into a wellde_x000C_ned and coherent general system. Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe created panning trajectories.}

Two parameters are used to define thecontrol parameter space -- a simple automatic gain control system to controlthe output level, and a band-pass filter frequency for controlling the pitch ofthe feedback. This control parameter space is mapped to a corpus of soundscreated by these parameters and recorded, and these sounds are analysed usingsoftware created for concatenative synthesis. Following this process, thedescriptors taken from the analysis can be used to select control parametersfrom the feedback system.}

The smart tangibles developed for this interface are able to sense howthey are grasped by the user. The paper presents the design of the mixing interface including the smart tangible as well as a preliminary user study involving a hands-on focus group session where 5 different control technologiesare contrasted and discussed. Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibles were preferred, but that an optimal interface would include a combination of touch, smart tangibles and an extra function control tangible for extending the functionality of the smart tangibles. Finally, the interface should incorporate both an edit and mix mode---the latter displaying very limited visual feedback in order to force users to focus their attention to listening instead of the interface.}

The results achieved are encouraging and led to useful insights about how to improve instrument features, performance and usability.}

The focus of this paper is on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer's objective is to guide the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed, theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other. However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics, etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.}

Our target application is so-called motion controllers,i.e. systems that interpret hand motion for musical interaction. In earlierresearch we found effective methods to design nearly optimal filters forreal-time applications. However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is necessary to establish the typical frequency contentof the motion capture data we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters and low-pass differentiators of degrees one and two, which in ourexperience are the most useful filters for our target application.}

Our system enables an augmentation of the musical properties by adding different musical channels triggered and parameterized by natural gestures during the ``performance''.

To capture and treat the different expressive parameters both natural and intentional, our platform is composed of a metallic structure supporting sensors. The measured values are processed by an arduino system that finallysends the results by serial communication to a Max/MSP patch for signaltreatment and modification. We will explain how our embedded instrument aims to bring a certain awareness to the player of the mapping and the potential musical freedom of the very specific -- and not that much automatic --- instrument that is a music box. We will also address how our design tackles the different questions of mapping, ergonomics and expressiveness while choosing the controller modalities and the parameters to be sensed.}

A music performance can be described with compositional and expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we often observe particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a "gesture", since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuming a finite number of latent states on each property value changes, we can describe those gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train them by unsupervised learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us a measure for different effects of each properties on the gesture implementation. Test result on some of real performances indicates that the trained models could capture the structure of gestures observed in the given performances, and detect their boundaries. The entropy-based measure was informative to understand the effectiveness of each property on the gesture implementation. Test result on large corpora indicates that our model has potentials for afurther model improvement.}

One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be available to report by thetime of the conference in May.}

Thistechnology is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance, which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music. The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software, which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate theperformer's gesture into sound.

Such a system would allow two percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.}

  abstract = {Although multi-touch user interfaces have become a widespread form of humancomputer interaction in many technical areas, they haven't found their way intolive performances of musicians and keyboarders yet. In this paper, we present anovel multi-touch interface method aimed at professional keyboard players. Themethod, which is inspired by computer trackpads, allows controlling up to tencontinuous parameters of a keyboard with one hand, without requiring the userto look at the touch area --- a significant improvement over traditional keyboardinput controls. We discuss optimizations needed to make our interface reliable,and show in an evaluation with four keyboarders of different skill level thatthis method is both intuitive and powerful, and allows users to more quicklyalter the sound of their keyboard than they could with current input solutions.}

In this paper we show a flexible linear-potentiometer and forcesensitive-resistor (FSR) based solution for position, pressure and force sensing between the contact point of the fingers and the musical instrument. A flexible matrix printed circuit board (PCB) is fixed on a piano key. We further introduce linear potentiometer based left hand finger position sensing for string instruments, integrated into a violin and a guitar finger board. Several calibration and measurement scenarios are shown. The violin sensor was evaluated with 13 music students regarding playability and robustness of the system. Main focus was a the integration of the sensors into these two traditional musical instruments as unobtrusively as possible to keep natural haptic playing sensation. The musicians playing the violin in different performance situations stated good playability and no differences in the haptic sensation while playing. The piano sensor is rated, due to interviews after testing it in a conventional keyboard quite unobtrusive, too, but still evokes a different haptic sensation.}

However, the visualisation and triggeringof lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely limiting the artist's freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment. We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality, results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.}

General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject's hand movements.Presentation of audio information in this manner could be beneficial for`pre-feeling' as a method for selecting material to play during a liveperformance, assisting visually impaired audio engineers, and as a generalaugmentation of standard audio editing environments.}

In these cases, a front-end processing system for extracting gestural information embedded in the sensor data is essential. In this paper we propose an unsupervised offline method that learns how to reduce and map the gestural data to a generic instrument parameter control space. We make an unconventional use of the Self-Organizing Maps to obtain only a geometrical transformation of the gestural data, while dimensionality reduction is handled separately. We introduce a novel training procedure to overcome two main Self-Organizing Maps limitations which otherwise corrupt the interface usability. As evaluation, we apply this method to our existing Voice-Controlled Interface for musical instruments, obtaining sensible usability improvements.}

Our approach, called Rouages,is based on a mixed-reality display system and a 3D visualization application.It reveals the mechanisms of digital musical instruments by amplifyingmusicians' gestures with virtual extensions of the sensors, by representingthe sound components with 3D shapes and specific behaviors and by showing theimpact ofmusicians gestures on these components.

Then, the system finds onset and pitch of the note from the signal, to align this information with the ground truth musical score. Real-time alignment allows the system to evaluate whether the user played the correct note or not, regardless of its timing, which enables user to play at their own speed, as playing same tempo with original musical score is problematic for beginners. As an output of evaluation, the system notifies the user about which part they are currently performing, and which note were played incorrectly.}

The construction of isomorphic instruments, beyond limited square isomorphisms present in many stringed instruments, has been a challenge in the past for two reasons: The first problem, that of re-arranging note actuators from their sounding elements, has been solved by digital instrument design. The second, more conceptual problem, is that only a single isomorphism can be designed for any one instrument, requiring the instrument designer (as well as composer and performer) to "lock in" to a single isomorphism, or to have a different instrument for each isomorphism in order to experiment. Musix (an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device) are two new musical instruments built to overcome this and other limitations of existing isomorphic instruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation with a wide variety of different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages and disadvantages of each. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade buttons embedded with RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of the isomorphism currently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments/experimentation platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible with existing instruments.}

To this end, we have developeda reactive environment for distributed performance that provides participantsdynamic, real-time control over several aspects of their performance, enablingthem to change volume levels and experience exaggerated stereo panning. Inaddition, our reactive environment reinforces a feeling of a ``shared space'' between musicians. It differs most notably from standard ventures into thedesign of novel musical interfaces and installations in its reliance onuser-centric methodologies borrowed from the field of Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI). Not only does this research enable us to closely examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore newinterpretations of the network as a performance space. This paper describes themotivation and background behind our project, the work that has been undertakentowards its realization and the future steps that have yet to be explored.}

It is hoped that the techniques described in this paper afford performers and composers an enhanced level of creative expression in the diffusion performance practice.

It describes how tactile.space implements Vector Base Amplitude Panning to achieve real-time source positioning.

To evaluate PESI with skilled musicians,a user-test jam session was conducted. Musicians' comments indicate that thesystem facilitates group interaction finely to bring up further intentions tomusical ideas. Results from our user-test jam session indicate that, through some modificationof the 'in-space' response to the improvisation, and through more intuitiveinteractions with the 'on-body' mobile instruments, we could make thecollaborative music activity a more engaging and active experience. Despitebeing only user-tested once with musicians, the group interview has raisedfruitful discussions on the precise details of the system components.Furthermore, the paradigms of musical interaction and social actions in groupactivities need to be questioned when we seek design requirements for such acollaborative environment. We introduced a system that we believe can open upnew ways of musical exploration in group music activity with a number ofmusicians. The system brings up the affordances of accessible technologieswhile creating opportunities for novel design applications to be explored. Ourresearch proposes further development of the system, focusing on movementbehavior in long-term interaction between performers.
