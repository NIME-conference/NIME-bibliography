  abstract = {Extended Reality Interfaces open numerous opportunities for musical expression. One of them is 3D musical drawing, i.e., the ability to draw sonic and visual paths in virtual and physical spaces. However, in existing instruments (controllers, hand tracking) most of the interaction happens in the digital/virtual space which reduces primary audio and haptic feedback and might limit the expressiveness one has with physical drawing and acoustic instruments.In this paper, we propose a novel design approach which moves part of the 3D interaction back to the physical space for more intimate controls and more direct feedback, creating a physical interaction loop connected with the virtual interaction loop. We then present MagneTip, a first implementation of this approach for 3D musical drawing, which enables one or two handed interaction and combines co-localised and spatialised feedback.  We believe that our physical interaction loop approach could be applied to other paradigms of 3D musical interaction.}

  abstract = {The T-Stick, an interface with a lifetime of nearly 17 years, has undergone multiple changes over time. Over the first decade and a half of its existence, the T-Stick was manufactured in various sizes (four) and copies (> 30 units). Despite the relatively large numbers in the context of in-house academic interfaces, over the past 6 years many T-Sticks were made fairly artisanally, with graduate students manufacturing their own devices.  Despite this strategy's clear pedagogical advantages, the reliability of these devices was not always a priority, leading to the need for repairs and downtime during use. In this paper, we present the design for the 5th generation of T-Sticks, the T-Stick 5GW, designed to improve the reliability and maintainability of the interface to reduce faults during extended periods of use dramatically. The main changes in this new generation are the use of a custom-made ESP32-S3 board, which integrates a fuel gauge and IMU. In addition, the touch sensor is printed on a flexible PCB and interfaces with the touch board using a 32-pin FFC connector, dramatically reducing the need for soldering parts. Requirements relating to the instrument's reliability/availability and manufacturing are described in detail and were evaluated analytically, showing the effectiveness of the new design. Further reliability testing is ongoing through the use of the latest generation in musical performances.}

Part of the Women's Labor feminist project that creates Embedded Acoustic Instruments using old domestic tools, RRR is anchored by a base that acts as resonator for the system and includes sensors—potentiometers (rheostats) and a rotary encoder—embedded into its physical architecture. RRR detects the weight of hanging clothes and velocity of rotation by hand or wind. Motivated by the feminist concept of reproductive commons, we invite the public to do and witness communal housework in interactive installation and musical performance, in order to challenge gender inequality in domestic work division. A composition written for RRR, A Body of Resistance, draws upon quotes by rheostat inventor Mary Hallock-Greenewalt to address women's struggles for equal treatment. The sound designs for RRR and A Body of Resistance take inspiration from the drying rack’s original wind-powered utility, using aerophone sounds and vibrational modelling of pipes and bars. By reimagining domestic tools with embedded technologies, we envision a musical housework commons that can act as a catalyst for social change.}

Haptic technologies have seen significant advances in gaming, virtual reality training, and as an auxiliary output in select music performance and playback systems. However, there are currently no stand-alone haptic music/art systems that allow for the easy creation and distribution of haptic music/art. Despite the convergence of haptics research and music technology, the perspectives of the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) communities remain underrepresented in the field of creative haptic technology development. Recognizing the potential of more readily available haptic art creation and sharing systems for the Deaf and/or Disabled community, we conducted a co-design workshop with 27 DHH middle school children, focusing on their experiences with haptic vibrations, creating low-fidelity prototypes for haptic art presentation devices, and composing short pieces of haptic music. Through a mixed-methods analysis of survey responses, reflections, and thematic analysis of the prototypes and haptic art compositions, we gained valuable insights into the aesthetic possibilities and considerations for future haptic art instruments. By elevating haptic music/art as a distinct category of work not always subservient to auditory music, we hope to pave the way for more inclusive and accessible technologies in the realm of artistic expression and enrich the experiences of diverse communities in the world of art and creativity.}

However, the education of oral music genres, traditionally reliant on live demonstration and imitation, is undergoing a contrasting transformation by rapidly embracing online means. This study explores challenges in the embodied aspects of synchronous distance Hindustani music pedagogy, with a special focus on tactility. Taking an ethnomusicological perspective, the paper presents an analysis of interviews with Hindustani music practitioners, which is guided by the principles of the 4E Cognition framework.	The findings suggest that, while the adaptation to technology aims to broaden access to music content, it does so at the expense of limiting opportunities for multi-modal interaction among participants. The results highlight constraints in conveying non-verbal, embodied, and multi-sensory cues, as well as disruptions in visual and acoustic, but most importantly tactile elements, that contribute to an otherwise shared spatial and physical context. These challenges hinder meaningful interaction and immersive experiences, crucial elements in music education. The study expresses concerns about the appropriateness of conventional videoconferencing platforms and offers valuable insights for developing alternative technologies, better suited to meet the embodied demands of these pedagogical practices.}

The method is based on an array of optical distance sensors in combination with a regression machine learning model to predict the position at and the amount by which each cord is displaced from a baseline tensioned position. Capacitive strips on the back of the neck of the instrument afford additional timbral control.

Even two decades after these tactile interfaces, it remains crucial to question why a well-defined research trajectory on this subject has not been established. This places the search for new connections between granular synthesis techniques and tangible interface design at the core of this work, which aims to explore novel expressive forms of interaction with granular synthesis. To achieve this, an enactive exploration of physical materials with granular properties was conducted, followed by the implementation of an apparatus capable of capturing and recognizing interactions with these materials. Subsequently, the Tangible Granular Device was designed and implemented to facilitate interaction with these materials according to a set of guidelines of tangible interfaces and enactivism in musical instruments. Finally, the paper discusses the outcomes of the process, reflects on the current state of enactive design, and proposes improvements for future versions of this instrument. }

Our design of a breath-based vocal wearable instrument incorporated uncontrollable aspects of a vocalist's body and its physical change over different timescales. We distinguish the body in the design process and acknowledge its agency in vocal instrument design. Reflection on our co-design process between vocal pedagogy and eTextile fashion perspectives demonstrates how Body Lutherie can generate empathy and understanding of the body as a collaborator in future instrument design and artistic practice.}

  abstract = {This paper investigates the field of spatialization tools and controllers within the context of immersive sound formats. After examining conventional approaches, we redefine spatialization tools as musical instruments challenging prevailing views of digital musical instruments confined to interface and synthesis components. Our exploration encompasses the projection, movement, and control of sound objects in diverse loudspeaker setups, emphasizing the reconnection of synthesis and space-related modulations. Addressing the multidimensional challenges associated with sound spatialization, we highlight some observed mapping strategies for the control of gestural and spatial information. In particular, we examine user-driven strategies, such as 'repurposed' controllers, 'interpreted' instruments, custom interfaces, and spatialized synthesis algorithms. Additionally, we introduce design patterns emphasizing an aesthetic standpoint, positioning music as space, advocating for the integration of loudspeaker topologies in the design process, and recoupling synthesis and spatialization. Illustrating our theoretical framework, we present three case studies of spatial digital musical instruments. These examples showcase the integration of spatialization with synthesis, offering a comprehensive approach to sound design. In conclusion, our exploration advocates for spatialization controller design strategies urging a transition to a more user-centric, adaptable, and holistic paradigm.}

These allow the control of sound synthesis and processing parameters to create a blend of acoustic and synthesized sounds. The core idea is to remap the existing fingering gestures, exploiting acoustically unresponsive holes of the ney flute for enhanced control. Additional interaction methods include lip positioning and instrument movement. We evaluated the system through a study focused on audience reactions, suggesting engaging sonic and visual elements. We complemented this evaluation by including the first author's self-reflections as Hyper-Ney performer.}

Our preliminary study with seven traditional musicians reveals that they find playing with the system to be enjoyable, and appreciated its musicality; but they scored its humanness and responsiveness less highly. These findings suggest that such real-time performance systems might bring an enjoyable "otherness" to musical performance, even for traditional forms of music.

I will in this paper report on how an augmented clarinet that I, together with a team at LTU began developing in 2015 has continued to develop over the past seven years. The focus will be on the development of artistic applications within the system. Performers frequently describe the resistance of their instrument as a manifestation of the challenges they encounter when playing. One can argue that the goal of a skilled performer is to get rid of resistance, but it is in fact a central part of the relationship between performer and instrument. Acquiring technique and skill seems to be a way for the performer not to overcome resistance but to learn how the instrument responds to force. Realizing the importance of resistance in the artistic process we need to ask ourselves; how can we use this knowledge when creating new instruments? Returning to video documentation of performances with two different mappings and through stimulated recall analysis I seek a deeper understanding of how software, mapping and performance practice interacts, forming the basis of the artistic expression.}

Designed for live performance with a human performer and as a standalone sound installation, the \emph{ansambl} consists of sixteen bespoke virtual singers arranged in a circle. When performing live, the virtual singers listen to the human performer and respond to their singing by reading pitch, intonation and volume cues. In a standalone sound installation mode, singers use ultrasonic distance sensors to sense audience presence. Developed as part of the 1st author's practice-based PhD and artistic practice as a live performer, this work employs the \emph{singing-voice} to explore voice interactions in HCI beyond language, and innovative ways of live performing. How is technology supporting the effect of intimacy produced through voice? Does the act of surrounding the audience with responsive virtual singers challenge the traditional roles of performer-listener? To answer these questions, we draw upon the 1st author's experience with the system, and the interdisciplinary field of voice studies that consider the voice as the sound medium independent of language, capable of enacting a reciprocal connection between bodies.}

The Sonic Wings were developed using found speakers inside cardboard-made acoustic waveguides, a microcomputer accessed remotely, and a portable audio interface connected to a clippable microphone. Mounted to the performer’s body, this system allows the performer to move freely while playing and interacting with the device across a performance space in which audiences stand and move spontaneously. This study’s approach to interactions with body-mounted interfaces in musical performance challenges notions of control introducing notions of companionship. Engaging with the figure of the cyborg as proposed by Haraway, this paper discusses how the development of such device unfolds the embodiment of hybrid ontologies through musical performance enabling interactions with audiences through movement across an acoustically evolving space.}

We developed this tool to have an easier learning curve, and a low barrier of entry. xrOSC is an isotonic mixed reality controller interface with six degrees of freedom and direct absolute input designed for standalone extended reality devices. By utilizing hand tracking and gestural control, we can enable more natural and intuitive positioning of sound sources in 3D audio spatialization of the external composed space, as opposed to using spatialization tools on a traditional 2D display with mouse/keyboard input methods. This software is designed specifically as a control method, as there is no processing done on the device. xrOSC simply sends control messages over the network to a spatialization backend using the Open Sound Control protocol.

In The Unfinder, we aim to exploit the balance between accurately and reliably retrieving audio material from a file search system, and the potential for failure in the system to do so. Our prior research is used to frame design choices which are measured with a user study used to evaluate the interface. In the study we observed nine users of varying musical backgrounds playing with the instrument while taking notes of their utterances and ideas. The transcriptions of the user’s comments were analyzed using a thematic analysis method and five (5) themes were identified: perception, parameterization, identity, agency, and imaginaries. These themes indicate that the interface design is promising for artistic output, the use of a single feature for searching does not have much perceptual relevance, and the chosen features are useful for discovering audio files within serendipitous musical situations.}

This particular instrument design approach works in parallel with a performance practice centered on live construction of new music, refinement of a groove and the creative process of troubleshooting.	In my practice I use an extended turntable system, developing new electro-mechanical interfaces between a record player and various other devices. The paper describes my approach to developing the Mechanical Techno project, using the system in live musicking contexts and making iterations of the setup. The aesthetic aims of the project are defined in order to highlight the types of mechanical and electronic errors and flaws which are important to its success.	Several specific examples are given by way of illustration, demonstrating how physical wobbles, imprecise triggering and out-of-sync mechanisms can lead to interesting and idiosyncratic elements in live performances and recorded compositions.The approach is summarised as a process of 'ironing in the creases': recognising the system's problems and – counterintuitively – deliberately emphasising them.}

Two Recurrent Neural Networks based on Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory were developed to analyze sEMG signals in real-time. The system was designed as a digital musical instrument that calibrates itself to each user during an initial training process. During training musicians provide their gestural vocabulary, associating each gesture to a corresponding pedalboard preset. The selection of the most effective features, in synergy with the best set of muscles, was conducted to optimize the learning rate of the system. The system was assessed with a user study encompassing seven expert guitar players. Results showed that, on average, participants appreciated the concept underlying the system and deemed it to be able to foster their creativity.}

  abstract = {This paper explores the sound and music possibilities obtained from the sonification of a swarm of coupled oscillators moving in a virtual space called "Swarmalators". We describe the design and implementation of a Human-Swarm Interactive Music System based on the 3D version of the Swarmalator model, which is used for signal analysis of the overall sound output in terms of scalability; that is, the effect of varying the number of agents in a swarm system. We also study the behaviour of autonomous swarmalators in the presence of one user-controlled agent, which we call the interactive swarmalator. We observed that sound frequencies barely deviate from their initial values when there are few agents, but they diverge significantly in a highly dense swarm. Additionally, with the inclusion of the interactive swarmalator, the group's behaviour tends to adjust towards it. We use these results to explore the potential of swarmalators in music performance under various scenarios. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges to use the Swarmalator model for sound and music systems.}

It seeks to bridge different communities through playful and engaging means, particularly including individuals who face barriers in traditional music-making practices. This Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) is conceptualized based on insights derived from discussions and meetings with blind individuals and therapists. Its primary objective is to explore the creative potential of the white cane as an interactive medium. The design process involved incorporating feedback and perspectives from these stakeholders, to ensure the device's relevance and effectiveness in addressing the unique needs and experiences of users with visual impairments. To realize these objectives, a musical interactive installation has been produced, marking the first iteration of a prototype for a multi-user experience.

The study explores the transition from traditional theremins, commonly recreated in music programming classes, to the visually engaging Bareëmin family. In this evolution, the conventional antennae are replaced by creatively envisioned antennae, becoming a defining feature across varied shapes and sizes, categorized into handheld, environmental, and painted score species.Rooted in the artist's synesthetic perception, where sight and sound converge, Bareëmins embody diegetic shapes and colors. The antennae, made from conductive paint, copper tape, or found materials, showcase a commitment to sustainability and inclusivity. The paper provides instructions for crafting Bareëmins using readily available materials, fostering an environmentally conscious approach. By enhancing the artistic appeal and making the construction accessible, Bareëmins bridge the gap between visual artistry and musicality, offering a unique and inclusive avenue for exploring the intersection of art and technology in the realm of musical instrument design.}

Although the use of music is developing in a range of contexts such as choirs, song writing groups, and more specific therapies, these often rely on musical knowledge or the expertise of facilitators. Limited tools are available which facilitate unguided musical experiences, fostering agency for their users through musical creativity.We present a workshop-based study exploring the use of a procedural music platform designed for those living with dementia and cognitive decline. The paper takes a mixed-methods approach, exploring a range of procedural processes, and reviewing participant engagement during their use. We demonstrate the use of the platform and highlight its potential for engagement. We evaluate the techniques implemented and demonstrate an inverse relationship between operational complexity and interaction. We conclude it is possible to facilitate engaging musical interactions which foster agency and creativity while maintaining rich and age-appropriate outputs.}

But there is a twist. Unlike "I Am Sitting in a Room," which  unfolds as a gradual process with no further interaction once the process has begun, I Am Sitting in a (Latent) Room gives the improvisers the ability to intervene and interact with the process of degradation in real time. An audio clip is repeatedly encoded and decoded through two parallel instances of a bespoke variational autoencoder (VAE) model. On top of this process, the performers manipulates the model's latent embeddings in real-time, exploring the latent space (or "room") of the model over the course of the performance. Two performances with the composer and live-coding duo RGGTRN are presented. This work explores human-in-the-loop AI systems through group improvisation, interactive AI performance, and creating datasets as a part of the compositional process.}

However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how timbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method facilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral differences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.}

Movements are detected using computer vision principles to identify shapes, lines, and the motions of the performer’s stitches. Gestures the performer uses are then mapped to a synthesizer that produces mu- sic according to how the player moves, while they knit and purl. Each performance varies due to the speed at which the performer knits, the technical knitting style of the per- former, the kinds of stitches cast on the needles, the color and texture of yarn used during performance, and the size of the knitting project.}

  abstract = {Deformable interface is an emerging field with significant potential for use in computing applications, particularly in the design of Digital Music Instruments (DMIs). While prior works have investigated the design of gestural input for deformable interfaces and developed novel musical interactions, there remains a gap in understanding the tangible gestures as input and their corresponding output from the user's perspectives. This study explores the relationship between gestural input and the output of a deformable interface for multi-gestural music interaction. Following a pilot study to explore materials and their corresponding intuitive gestures with participants, we develop a TPU fabric interface as a probe to investigate this question in the context of musical interaction. Through user engagement with the probe as a sound control, we discovered that the input-output relationship between gestures and the sound can have meaningful implications for users' embodied interaction with the system. Our research deepens the understanding of designing deformable interfaces and their capacity  to enhance embodied experiences in music interaction scenarios.}

This paper delves into applying coupled oscillator networks from sound synthesis to composition. It employs mathematical viewpoints grounded in coupled oscillators, comparing the Kuramoto model and the recently discovered Janus model for simulating musical frameworks by formulating and implementing the simulation of Janus oscillator networks to exploit the perspectives of generative and nonlinear in the composition process. Coupled oscillators implemented with multiple agents can be used at an analytic level with different types of parametric space, and complex behavior depends on each coupling value of the group and each agent’s relationship. It can be exploited at various levels of settings in the composition and sound synthesis stages. I outline the way of sound synthesis through the simulation of Janus network oscillators to find the meaning of compositional techniques underlying the self-organized principles.}

Among such systems, streaming autoencoders such as RAVE are particularly suitable for instrument design, as they map audio to and from control signals in an abstract latent space with acceptable latency. Despite the uptake of autoencoders in NIME design, little research has been done to characterize the latent spaces of audio models, and to investigate their affordances in practical musical scenarios. In this paper we present Stacco, an instrument specifically designed for the intuitive control of neural audio synthesis latent parameters through the displacement of magnetic objects on a wooden board with four magnetic attractors. We then examine models trained on the same data with different seeds, we explore strategies for more consistent mappings from audio to latent space, and propose a method for stitching the latent space of one model to another. Finally, in a user study, we investigate whether and how these techniques are perceived through embodied practice with Stacco.}

This tendency of AI art to bring forth the uncanny, emerging also in my design and performative work with NIMEs, echoes the methods of an artistic movement known as sonic hauntology. In this paper I elaborate on Derrida's and Fisher's notion of hauntology, a theoretical framework investigating ontology's liminalities, and an artistic current addressing the paradoxes of postmodern aesthetics through the magnification of the technological uncanny. I then apply this paradigm to creative AI, arguing that the model's algorithmic manipulation of the training data reproduces and exponentially accelerates the processes of temporal and semantic flattening that characterise postmodern aesthetics. The frictions produced by creative AI as it operates with and within the culture bring forth hauntological disjunctures, that artists might harness as an instrument of critique, and scholars as a novel epistemic method. Finally, I introduce AI hauntography, a practice-based methodology combining artistic practice and observation to investigate the phenomenological aspects of creative AI as they intersect with the broader technical and sociopolitical discourse. }

The combination of both expansions extends the timbral qualities of the saxophone into new territories. The different tone generators turn the saxophone into a flute, a sarrusophone, a modern variation of the Renaissance cornett, and a free-reed instrument with each instrument class's distinct sonic characters. The foot-controller system consists of a trackball operated by the big toe of one foot with separate pedals to simulate the mouse buttons with the other foot. The system also includes a traditional MIDI bass pedal, an expression pedal, and a wide-spaced ASCII keyboard. In particular, the trackball system enables complex timbre changes and a flexible processing flow needed for freely improvised music. It can be used to control a complete personal computer. The learning curve to develop the feet's fine motor skills is comparable to learning new embouchures for the different tone generators.}

The performance was designed for a 270 degree concert hall which allows the audience to see each other. In this setting, by employing mobile phones not only as communication devices but as light emitters, we explore the symbiotic relationship among the various actors in a performance. To achieve that, we developed a computer vision system designed to translate the audience participation into shaping the sonic landscape of the performance. This process is underpinned by considerations of cybernetics and the feedback loop between human participants and technological systems, challenging conventional power structures within performance spaces. Through this work, we aim to expand the boundaries of interactive music creation, offering insights into the potential for technologically-facilitated audience entanglement and further the discussion with the context of music ecology. }

Today's AI methods offer the opportunity to recognize such techniques and repurpose them in real-time, leading to new forms of interactions between musicians and machines. This paper is the result of a collaboration between a composer/double-bass player and researchers, born from the musician's desire for an interactive improvisational experience with AI centered around the practice of his extended techniques. With this aim, we developed Esteso: an interactive improvisational system based on extended technique recognition, live electronics, and a timbre-transfer double-bass model. We evaluated our system with the musician with three duet improvisational sessions, each using different mapping strategies between the techniques and the sound of the virtual double bass counterpart. We collected qualitative data from the musician to gather insights about the three configurations and the corresponding improvisational duets, as well as investigate the resulting interactions. We provide a discussion about the outcomes of our analysis and draw more general design considerations.}

This work builds on a study that includes interviews with 27 digital luthiers from various backgrounds and varied motivations, originally motivated to better understand tool use in digital lutherie. The themes presented provide constructed narratives that affirm assumptions that intuitively appear likely and provide interesting insights and developments for further exploration that are fitting and relevant to the NIME community.  This discussion finds nuances in how digital luthiers approach design, both as a problem and in search of inspiration. It also explores how interaction and control are often the primary focus of digital luthiers and that they emphasise opinionated and directed design choices. These ideas are then considered in relation to existing ideas from the field.}

Here, we survey the NIME archive and provide an overview of the work on non-rigid interfaces. Further, this paper presents a new textile based musical interface and evaluates its potential as a malleable, expressive instrument through a case study with 6 musicians. The findings of the qualitative analysis conclude a set of guidelines for the development of future e-textile interfaces.}

  abstract = {The close relationship between touch, gesture, and sound plays a critical role in expressive musical performance. Many acoustic instruments, ranging from strings to brass to percussion, involve some coupling of the “feel” of the instrument in the hands and the corresponding sound produced. The singing voice, however, is one of few musical instruments that typically does not involve touch-mediated interaction. Despite several neurological, psychological, and social connections demonstrated between the hands and voice, the coupling of touch and voice is surprisingly absent from traditional vocal performance technologies. This provides the motivation for VocalCords, which explores the design of a new digital music interface inviting tactile interaction and performance with the singing voice. The interface makes use of physical rubber cords, acting as stretch sensors, which are pulled and manipulated by the hands of the singer as they vocalize to augment and modify their voice in real-time – as if they were able to physically “touch” their own vocal cords. This approach allows for expressive, tactile control over the singing voice, which suggests a striking relationship between physical and musical tension. Through a series of prototyping iterations and a public performance with the interface, I explore the potential of touch-mediated vocal performance, as well as how this added tactile interaction may alter our experience with, and perception of, our singing voices.}

In this paper, a novel approach to tactile interaction with physical modelling synthesis is presented, through the use of a self-sensing vibrotactile transducer. This enables simultaneous collocated sensing and haptic actuation with a single moving coil transducer. A current drive amplifier is used for haptic actuation, using signals derived from the physical modelling synthesiser. The varying impedance of the transducer (due to changes in the mechanical damping) enables the sensing of force applied upon the device whilst also acting as a pickup to excite the physical model, all with simultaneous haptic actuation. A digital filter equivalent of the transducer's impedance is used to prevent feedback in the system, allowing simultaneous excitation and haptic actuation without self-oscillation.}

We propose using unsupervised machine learning to encode sketches into lower-dimensional latent representations, which are then used as the source for the IML model to construct sketch-to-sound mappings. We build a proof-of-concept prototype and demonstrate it using two compositions. We reflect on the composing processes to discuss the controllability and explorability in mappings built by this approach and how they contribute to the musical expression.}

This paper introduces Sonic Touch, a toolkit developed in Max/MSP that facilitates the rapid prototyping of audio-driven vibrotactile haptic effects. The toolkit allows users to design a variety of haptic effects by manipulating parameters like wave type, vibration duration, frequency, repetition, and envelope, then store and manage them in buffers for output. The toolkit’s architecture is grounded in a modular, building-block approach, accessible through a simple graphical user interface. Practical use of this toolkit is demonstrated through two examples, first designing a haptic tremolo effect, and second augmenting a Touché controller with vibrotactile feedback.}

Unlike convective heating technologies that change the temperature of the air around us, radiative heating works by directly heating the surface of our skin via infrared. The technology is widely used in portable heaters in outdoor dining areas of restaurants. One interesting advantage of radiative heating is that if the source of infrared radiation is shaded by a thermally reflective surface, the change in perceived temperature by a person near the heater is very rapid. We worked to create a system that could quickly control robotic shades in front of a radiative heater to synchronize changes in perceived temperature with music and light. We also explored the inverse, using thermal camera input as a control method for audio, and presented both of these techniques at a "Thermal Music" concert at Princeton University in October of 2023.}
