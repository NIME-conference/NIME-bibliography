  abstract = {This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio processing are utilized.  Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument's sound is modified by the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.}

Originally musebot development focused on software-only ensembles of musical agents, coded by a community of developers. More recent experiments have explored humans interfacing with musebot ensembles in various ways: including through electronic interfaces in which parametric control of high-level musebot parameters are used; message-based interfaces which allow human users to communicate with musebots in their own language; and interfaces through which musebots have jammed with human musicians. Here we report on the recent developments of human interaction with musebot ensembles and reflect on some of the implications of these developments for the design of metacreative music systems.}

At a formative stage in exploring audio AR technology, we conducted an audience experience study investigating questions around the potential of audio AR in creating sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected interview evidence about the participants' experience and analysed the data with using a grounded theory approach.  The results demonstrated that the technology has the potential to create immersive spaces where an audience can feel safe to experiment musically, and showed how AR can intervene in sound perception to instrumentalise an environment.  The results also revealed caveats about the use of audio AR, mainly centred on social inhibition and seamlessness of experience, and finding a balance between mediated worlds so that there is space for interplay between the two.}

The software is used in the development a series of recordings, similarly titled as AM MODE. Programmed in Max/MSP, the software uses live audio input from individual instruments within the drum set as control parameters for modulation synthesis. By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers, audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications. The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming a sonic hybrid.  }

All this information is mapped into the synthesis engine, which implements different kind of synthesis techniques for different shapes. In CABOTO the score is viewed as a cartographic map explored by some navigators. These navigators traverse the score in a semi-autonomous way, scanning the graphic elements found along their paths. The system tries to challenge the boundaries between the concepts of composition, score, performance, instrument, since the musical result will depend both on the composed score and the way the navigators will traverse it during the live performance. }

Disfluency, defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument, the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.}

The Theremin Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremin's ability, enabling it to produce five distinct new textures beyond the original.  It also features a looping system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.   }

Borrowing the best from TidalCycles, Siren augments the pattern creation process by introducing various interface level features: a multi-channel sequencer, local and global parameters, mathematical expressions, and pattern history. It presents new opportunities for recording, refining, and reusing the playback information with the pattern roll component. Subsequently, the paper concludes with a preliminary evaluation of Siren in the context of user interface design principles, which originates from the cognitive dimensions framework for musical notation design.}

Our objective was to design a device that affords exploratory modes of interaction with the performer's surroundings, as well as precise control over microtonal pitch content and other concomitant parameters.  The instrument is comprised of a hand-held wand, containing two piezo-electric transducers affixed to a pair of metal probes.  The performer uses the wand to physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals.  Input materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis, in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances.  We achieved gestural control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch.  As a unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partch's “monophonic fabric” of Just Intonation—specifically his conception of odentities, udentities, and a variable numerary nexus.  This system classifies pitch content based upon intervallic structures found in both the overtone and undertone series.  Our paper details the procedural challenges in designing the Harmonic Wand.}

  abstract = {Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments. These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation, timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical expression stems from the “transitive” perspective that musical expression is an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical expression focus on an “intransitive” perspective, where musical meaning is generated as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative capabilities unique to robotic instruments.}

  abstract = {Musical participation has brought individuals together in on-going communities throughout human history, aiding in the kinds of social integration essential for wellbeing. The design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs), however, has generally been driven by idiosyncratic artistic concerns, Western art music and dance traditions of expert performance, and short-lived interactive art installations engaging a broader public of musical novices. These DMIs rarely engage with the problems of on-going use in musical communities with existing performance idioms, repertoire, and social codes with participants representing the full learning curve of musical skill, such as social dance. Our project, Interactive Tango Milonga, an interactive Argentine tango dance system for social dance addresses these challenges in order to innovate connection, the feeling of intense relation between dance partners, music, and the larger tango community. }

This study took place in the setting of the Vocal Vibrations installation. For the experiment, participants engage in a multi sensory vocal exercise with a limited set of guidance to obtain a wide spectrum of vocal performances across participants. We compare characteristics of those vocal practices to the participant's heart rate, breathing rate, electrodermal activity and mental states. We obtained significant results suggesting that we can correlate psychophysiological states with characteristics of the vocal practice if we also take into account biographical information, and in particular mea- surement of how much people “like” their own voice.}

  abstract = {In order to facilitate access to playing music spontaneously, the prototype of an instrument which allows a more natural learning approach was developed as part of the research project Drum-Dance-Music-Machine. The result was a modular system consisting of several VST plug-ins, which on the one hand provides a drum interface to create sounds and tones and on the other hand generates or manipulates music through dance movement, in order to simplify the understanding of more abstract characteristics of music. This paper describes the development of a new software concept for the prototype, which since then has been further developed and evaluated several times. This will improve the maintainability and extensibility of the system and eliminate design weaknesses. To do so, the existing system first will be analyzed and requirements for a new framework, which is based on the concepts of event driven architecture and dependency injection, will be defined. The components are then transferred to the new system and their performance is assessed. The approach chosen in this case study and the lessons learned are intended to provide a viable solution for solving similar problems in the development of modular VST-based NIMEs.}

This type of neural network has a compact structure and is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties, we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work, we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery of the CTRNN creative search space.}

Within NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking, playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative value of ‘hijacking' formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.}

Three detailed examples -- biocontrollers, accordion-inspired instruments, and a networked intelligent controller --  illustrate how a complex suite of factors throughout the design, composition and performance processes can influence the development of idiomatic gestures. We argue that the explicit consideration of idiomatic gestures throughout the life cycle of new instruments can facilitate the emergence of style and give rise to performances that can develop rich layers of meaning.}

  abstract = {Machine learning and deep learning has recently made a large impact in the artistic community. In many of these applications however, the model is often used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output defined in the synth engine.  The system relies on learning these movements from a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output, our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the Lightpad instrument.}

Audio-morphing as a special field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization. Using multi-touch gestures to manipulate audio-morphing in a visual way, sound design and music production becomes more unrestricted and creative.}

Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However, the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments. Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not “tone deaf”. Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30% faster compared with learning from videos.}

Not all new musical instruments are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition of being new. So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their roles in performers' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs in the performers' practice and identify the values that are common among performers. We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers, and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional performance.}

  abstract = {An oft-cited aspiration of digital musical instrument (DMI) design is to create instruments, in the words of Wessel and Wright, with a ‘low entry fee and no ceiling on virtuosity'. This is a difficult task to achieve: many new instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performer's movement translates into the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians. In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness. This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result only seems to be true for expert players.}

  abstract = {This paper addresses the prevailing longevity problem of digital musical instruments (DMIs) in NIME research and design by proposing a holistic system design approach. Despite recent efforts to examine the main contributing factors of DMI falling into obsolescence, such attempts to remedy this issue largely place focus on the artifacts establishing themselves, their design processes and technologies. However, few existing studies have attempted to proactively build a community around technological platforms for DMIs, whilst bearing in mind the social dynamics and activities necessary for a budding community. We observe that such attempts while important in their undertaking, are limited in their scope. In this paper we will discuss that achieving some sort of longevity must be addressed beyond the device itself and must tackle broader ecosystemic factors. We hypothesize, that a longevous DMI design must not only take into account a target community but it may also require a non-traditional pedagogical system that sustains artistic practice.}

Each audio track has four two-bar loops which play in synchronisation switchable by its respective octave's first four black keys. The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface. All subjects agreed that all tools had creative performance potential that could be developed by further practice.}

CPGs are neural networks which generate adaptive rhythmic signals. They simulate structures in animals which underly behaviours such as heartbeat, gut peristalsis and complex motor control. Neurythmic is the first such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties of the CPG networks used (Matsuoka's Neural Oscillator), and describe methods for their control. Evaluation with expert and professional musicians shows that Neurythmic is a versatile tool, adapting well to a range of quite different musical approaches.}

  abstract = {Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others. For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard. This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface, finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between compositions that used either interface.}

In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor – two motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters. Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system. When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.}

This research compared three approaches to capturing hand gestures where the shape of the hand, i.e. the relative positions and angles of finger joints, are an important part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages for music applications. This study compared three approaches, using optical, inertial and muscular information, with three sets of 5 hand postures (i.e. static gestures) and gesture recognition algorithms applied to the device data, aiming to determine which methods are most effective.}

  abstract = {This paper reports upon the process of innovation of a new instrument. The author has developed the halldorophone a new electroacoustic string instrument which makes use of positive feedback as a key element in generating its sound.
An important objective of the project has been to encourage its use by practicing musicians. After ten years of use, the halldorophone has a growing repertoire of works by prominent composers and performers. During the development of the instrument, the question has been asked: “why do musicians want to use this instrument?” and answers have been found through on-going (informal) user studies and feedback. As the project progresses, a picture emerges of what qualities have led to a culture of acceptance and use around this new instrument.
This paper describes the halldorophone and presents the rationale for its major design features and ergonomic choices, as they relate to the overarching objective of nurturing a culture of use and connects it to wider trends.}

  abstract = {Laptop orchestras create music, although digitally produced, in a collaborative live performance not unlike a traditional orchestra. The recent increase in interest and investment in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel methods for musicians to create and interact with music. To this end, a number of nontraditional instruments have been constructed that enable musicians to control sound production beyond pitch and volume, integrating filtering, musical effects, etc. Wii Remotes (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use in maker communities, including laptop orchestras, for their robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors and the form factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music creation. In this paper, the authors present a new controller design, based on the WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-centric music performance. Based on the pilot-study data, the new controller offers unrestricted two-hand gesture production, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.}

  abstract = {In digital musical instrument design, different tools and methods offer a variety of approaches for constraining the exploration of musical gestures and sounds. Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to further investigate and extend this approach.}

This provides a proof-of-concept that this robotic fabrication technique might be a candidate method for creating novel metallic ideophones that are based on sheet deformations. Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication. In this paper we discuss this technique as well as aspects of the geometry of stadium cymbals and their impact on the resulting instrument.}

Through two experiments, the perceptual significance and overall musical contribution of the addition of haptic feedback in a listening context was evaluated. Subjects preferred listening to the classical guitar presentation with the addition of haptic feedback and the addition of haptic feedback contributed to listeners' engagement with a performance. The results of the experiments and their implications are discussed in this paper.}

  abstract = {The design of traditional musical instruments is a process of incremental refinement over many centuries of innovation. Conversely, digital musical instruments (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed varying degrees of `guitar-likeness', based either on the form and aesthetics of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing musical cultures.}

The intervention lasted three weeks during which the participant had a fully functional electrical guitar fitted with a strumming device controlled by a foot pedal at his free disposal. The device replaced right strumming of the strings, and the study showed that the participant, who was highly motivated, played 20 sessions despite system latency and reduced musical expression. He incorporated his own literature and equipment into his playing routine and improved greatly as the study progressed. He was able to play alone and keep a steady rhythm in time with backing tracks that went as fast as 120bpm. During the study he was able to lower his error rate to 33%, while his average flutter also decreased.}

Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this first iteration "Cabled Madness" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration "Onward to Mars" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit backpack. Now 10 years on, a new {robotcowboy 2.0} system powers a third iteration with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author's open-source iOS application which runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller support, and Open Sound Control communication.

It consisted of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind, and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional `performance' technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound, and vibration, and that the `inverse' control of the instrument was both challenging and pleasant.}

Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik's cube, and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a recreational tool.}

  abstract = {In this paper we present a novel digital effects controller for electric guitar based upon the whammy bar as a user interface. The goal with the project is to give guitarists a way to interact with dynamic effects control that feels familiar to their instrument and playing style. A 3D-printed prototype has been made. It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.}

A new student to the instrument is faced with mastering multiple, interconnected physical movements in order to become a skillful player. In their development, one measure of a players quality is their tone, which is the result of the combination of the physical characteristics of the instrument and their technique in playing it. This paper describes preliminary research into creating an intuitive, real-time device for evaluating the quality of tone generation on the cello: a ``timbre-tuner'' to aid cellists evaluate their tone quality. Data for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at different pitches on the A string was created. Results from informal listening tests support the use of the harmonic centroid as an appropriate measure for tone quality.}

People passing by the sculpture, or directly engaging it by creating light and shadows with their smart phone flashlights, will trigger the audio.  At the same time, it automatically adapts to gradual environment light changes, such as the rise and fall of the sun.  The piece was inspired by the searching gestures people make, and emotions they have while, idly browsing content on their smart devices.  It was created through an interdisciplinary collaboration between a musician, an interaction designer, and a ceramicist.}

Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.}

This paper investigates performance systems that facilitate improvisation where the musicians can interact not just by listening to each other and changing their own output, but also by manipulating the data stream of the other performer(s). In a course of performance-led research four prototypes were built and analyzed them using concepts from NIME and creative collaboration literature. Based on this analysis it was found that the systems should 1) provide a commonly modifiable visual representation of musical data for both coder and non-coder, and 2) provide some independent means of sound production for each user, giving the non-coder the ability to slow down and make non-realtime decisions for greater performance flexibility. }

  abstract = {This paper explores the role of materiality in Digital Musical Instruments and questions the influence of tacit understandings of sensor technology. Existing research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the ‘sensor layer' brings with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical response. }

This work investigates a series of discrete-time chaotic maps, which have the potential to generate intriguing sounds when they are adjusted to be on the edge of chaos.  With these chaotic maps as studied historically, the edge of chaos tends to be razor-thin, which can make it difficult to employ them for making new musical instruments.  The authors therefore suggest connecting chaotic maps with digital waveguides, which (1) make it easier to synthesize harmonic tones and (2) make it harder to fall off of the edge of chaos while playing a musical instrument.  The authors argue therefore that this technique widens the razor-thin edge of chaos into a musical highway.}

  abstract = {In computer or electroacoustic music, it is often the case that the compositional act and the parametric control of the underlying synthesis algorithms or hardware are not separable from each other. In these situations, composition and control of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy approach. }
