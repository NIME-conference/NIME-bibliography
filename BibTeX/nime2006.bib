In addition to musical parameters such as pitch and loudness, our system is able to analyze timbral characteristics of the saxophone tone in real-time, and use timbral information to guide the generation of response material. We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments in a free improvisation context. },

The 'GXtar' is an instrument which takes as a starting point a guitar but his role is to bring different and new musical possibilities while preserving the spirit and techniques of guitar. Therefore, it was conceived and carried out starting from the body of an electric guitar. The fingerboard of this guitar was equipped with two lines of sensors: linear position sensors, and tactile pressure sensors. These two lines of sensors are used as two virtual strings. Their two ends are the bridge and the nut of the guitar. The design of the instrument is made in a way that the position of a finger, on one of these virtual strings, corresponds to the note, which would have been played on a real and vibrating string. On the soundboard of the guitar, a controller, with 3 degrees of freedom, allows to drive other synthesis parameters. We then describe how this interface is integrated in a musical audio system and serves as a musical instrument. },

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe the networking of multiple Integral Music Controllers (IMCs) to enable an entirely new method for creating music by tapping into the composite gestures and emotions of not just one, but many performers. The concept and operation of an IMC is reviewed as well as its use in a network of IMC controllers. We then introduce a new technique of Integral Music Control by assessing the composite gesture(s) and emotion(s) of a group of performers through the use of a wireless mesh network. The Telemuse, an IMC designed precisely for this kind of performance, is described and its use in a new musical performance project under development by the ,

We present conga, a software framework that enables automatic recognition and interpretation ofconducting gestures. conga is able to recognize multiple types ofgestures with varying levels of difficulty for the user to perform,from a standard four-beat pattern, to simplified up-down conducting movements, to no pattern at all. conga provides an extendablelibrary of feature detectors linked together into a directed acyclicgraph; these graphs represent the various conducting patterns asgesture profiles. At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto match a user's gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo, gesture size, and the gesture'sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches, conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90%. conga is deployed as the gesture recognition systemfor Maestro!, an interactive conducting exhibit that opened in theBetty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee, USA in March2006.},

While it is impossible to cover all such developments, we have tried to sample a variety of instruments from the last decade or so, with a greater focus on those published in the computer music literature. Experiences in the field of string players focusing on such developments are presented. Conclusions are drawn in which further research into violin-related digital instruments for string players may benefit from the presented criteria as well as the experiences. },

The mapping/training interface provides a framework for performers to specify by example the mapping between gesture and sound or video controls. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the GRASSP environment for gestural control of musical expression by creating a gesture-to-voice system that is currently being used by performers. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes two new live performance scenarios for performing music using bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. Interaction between mobile phones via wireless link is a key feature of the performance interface for each scenario. Both scenarios are discussed in the context of two publicly performed works for an ensemble of players in which mobile phone handsets are used both as sound sources and as hand-held controllers. In both works mobile phones are mounted in a specially devised pouch attached to a cord and physically swung to produce audio chorusing. During performance some players swing phones while others operate phones as hand-held controllers. Wireless connectivity enables interaction between flying and hand-held phones. Each work features different bluetooth implementations. In one a dedicated mobile phone acts as a server that interconnects multiple clients, while in the other point to point communication takes place between clients on an ad hoc basis. The paper summarises bluetooth tools designed for live performance realisation and concludes with a comparative evaluation of both scenarios for future implementation of performance by large ensembles of nonexpert players performing microtonal music using ubiquitous technology. },

The video data are used to detect the moments of bow direction changes. This information is used for piece-wise integration of the accelerometer signal, resulting in a drift-free reconstructed velocity signal with a high temporal resolution. The method was evaluated using a 3D motion capturing system, providing a reliable reference of the actual bow velocity. The method showed good results when the accelerometer and video stream are synchronized. Additional latency and jitter of the camera stream can importantly decrease the performance of the method, depending on the bow stroke type. },
