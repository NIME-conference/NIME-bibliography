  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates whether a dynamic vibrotactile feedback improves the playability of a gesture controlled virtual instrument. The instrument described in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface. We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance. In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all. The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument. },

Several previously developed conducting interfaces do not satisfy users who have conducting experience because the feedback from the conducting action does not always correspond with a natural performance. The tempo scheduler, which is the main engine of a conducting system, must be improved. V.P. solves this problem by introducing heuristics of conducting an orchestra in detecting beats, applying rules regarding the tempo expression in a bar, etc. We confirmed with users that the system realized a high "following" performance and had musical persuasiveness. },

Drile allows musicians tointeract efficiently with these trees in an immersive environment.Nodes are represented as worms, which are 3D audiovisual objects. Worms can be manipulated using 3D interaction techniques,and several operations can be applied to the live-looping trees. Theenvironment is composed of several virtual rooms, i.e. group oftrees, corresponding to specific sounds and effects. Learning Drileis progressive since the musical control complexity varies according to the levels in live-looping trees. Thus beginners may havelimited control over only root worms while still obtaining musically interesting results. Advanced users may modify the trees andmanipulate each of the worms.},

In the course of creating a new piece for Mobile Phone Orchestra we propose the metaphor of a sound as a ball and explore the interactions and sound mappings it suggests. These lead to the design of a gesture-controlled instrument that allows players to "bounce" sounds, "throw" them to other players, and compete in a game to "knock out" others' sounds. We composed the piece SoundBounce based on these interactions, and note that audiences seem to find performances of the piece accessible and engaging, perhaps due to the visibility of the metaphor. },

Instead, visual images are used to define sound in terms of shape, size and location. Images can be sequenced into video, thereby creating rich and complex temporal soundscapes. The interface offers both the ability to craft soundscapes and also compose their evolution in time. },

The proposed system is based on capacitive sensors mounted on the fingerboard of the guitar. We presentthe setup of the sensor system and analyze its response toseveral finger movements.},

Various sensors and hardware are attached to the body and transmit signals to a workstation, where they are processed using Max/MSP. The game is divided into three levels, each of a different soundscape. The underlying purpose of our system is to move the player's focus away from complexities of the modern urban world toward a more internalized meditative state. The system is currently viewed as an interactive installation piece, but future iterations have potential applications in music therapy, bio games, extended performance art, and as a prototype for new interfaces for musical expression. },

A sonification algorithm generates unique compositions associated with the spectator "as measured" through their individual specification in performing an iconic measurement action.

This foamchanges electrical resistance when deformed; the controllerworks by measuring resistance at multiple points in a single piece of foam in order to track its shape. These measurements are complex and interdependent so an echo statenetwork, a form of recurrent neural network, is employed totranslate the sensor readings into usable control data.A cube shaped controller was built and evaluated in thecontext of the haptic exploration of sound synthesis parameter spaces. Eight participants experimented with the controller and were interviewed about their experiences. Thecontroller achieves its aim of enabling intuitive interaction,but in terms of nuanced interaction, accuracy and repeatability were issues for some participants. It's not clear fromthe short evaluation study whether these issues would improve with practice, a longitudinal study that gives musicians time to practice and find the creative limitations ofthe controller would help to evaluate this fully.The evaluation highlighted interesting issues concerningthe high level nature of malleable control and different approaches to sonic exploration.},

Our preliminary study investigates the non-verbal strategies employed for negotiation of our capacity for action with other bodies and the surrounding space through body-to-body and body-to-space couplings enabled by sensory supplementation devices. We employed a lowfi rapid prototyping approach to build this device, enabling distal perception by sonic and haptic feedback.

In this paper we describe a new way of interacting with the Wii remote and sensor bar to produce music. The Wiiolin is a virtual instrument which can mimic a violin or cello. Sensor bar motion relative to the Wii remote and button presses are analyzed in real-time to generate notes. Our design is novel in that it involves the remote's infrared camera and sensor bar as an integral part of music production, allowing users to change notes by simply altering the angle of their wrist, and henceforth, bow. The Wiiolin introduces a more realistic way of instrument interaction than other attempts that rely on button presses and accelerometer data alone. },

As network speeds increase and latency is consigned to history, tele-musical collaboration, and in particular improvisation will be shaped by new methodologies that respond to this potential. While networked technologies eliminate distance in physical space, for the remote improviser, this creates a liminality of experience through which their performance is mediated. As a first step in understanding the conditions arising from collaboration in networked audio platforms, this paper will examine selected case studies of improvisation in a variety of networked interfaces. The ,

author will examine how platform characteristics and network conditions influence the process of collective improvisation and the methodologies musicians are employing to negotiate their networked experiences. },

  Abstract                 = {Peacock is a newly designed interface for improvisational performances. The interface is equipped with thirty-five proximity sensors arranged in five rows and seven columns. The sensors detect the movements of a performer's hands and arms in a three-dimensional space above them. The interface digitizes the output of the sensors into sets of high precision digital packets, and sends them to a patch running in Pdextended with a sufficiently high bandwidth for performances with almost no computational resource consumption in Pd. The precision, speed, and efficiency of the system enable the sonification of hand gestures in realtime without the need to attach any physical devices to the performer's body. This paper traces the interface's evolution, discussing relevant technologies, hardware construction, system design, and input monitoring. },

  Abstract                 = {Since 2007, our research is related to the development of an anthropomorphic saxophonist robot, which it has been designed to imitate the saxophonist playing by mechanically reproducing the organs involved for playing a saxophone. Our research aims in understanding the motor control from an engineering point of view and enabling the communication. In this paper, the Waseda Saxophone Robot No. 2 (WAS-2) which is composed by 22-DOFs is detailed. The lip mechanism of WAS-2 has been designed with 3-DOFs to control the motion of the lower, upper and sideway lips. In addition, a human-like hand (16 DOF-s) has been designed to enable to play all the keys of the instrument. Regarding the improvement of the control system, a feed-forward control system with dead-time compensation has been implemented to assure the accurate control of the air pressure. In addition, the implementation of an auditory feedback control system has been proposed and implemented in order to adjust the positioning of the physical parameters of the components of the robot by providing a pitch feedback and defining a recovery position (off-line). A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic response of the air pressure control. },

A significant attribute of my Fuzzy Logic method is that it traces the trajectory of all musical details, since it is both the individual elements and their combination over time which is significant to the effectiveness of a musical work in achieving its goals. The goal of this work is to find a set of elements and rules, which will ultimately enable the construction of a genralised algorithmic compositional system which can produce expressive music if so desired. },

We developed a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance. },

  Abstract                 = {The number of artists who express themselves through music in an unconventional way is constantly growing. Thistrend strongly depends on the high diffusion of laptops,which proved to be powerful and flexible musical devices.However laptops still lack in flexible interface, specificallydesigned for music creation in live and studio performances.To resolve this issue many controllers have been developed,taking into account not only the performer's needs andhabits during music creation, but also the audience desire tovisually understand how performer's gestures are linked tothe way music is made. According to the common need ofadaptable visual interface to manipulate music, in this paper we present a custom tridimensional controller, based onOpen Sound Control protocol and completely designed towork inside Virtual Reality: simple geometrical shapes canbe created to directly control loop triggering and parametermodification, just using free hand interaction.},
