  Abstract                 = {We present the integration of two musical interfaces into a new music-making system that seeks to capture the expe-rience of a choir and bring it into the mobile space. This system relies on three pervasive technologies that each support a different part of the musical experience. First, the mobile device application for performing with an artificial voice, called ChoirMob. Then, a central composing and conducting application running on a local interactive display, called Vuzik. Finally, a network protocol to synchronize the two. ChoirMob musicians can perform music together at any location where they can connect to a Vuzik central conducting device displaying a composed piece of music. We explored this system by creating a chamber choir of ChoirMob performers, consisting of both experienced musicians and novices, that performed in rehearsals and live concert scenarios with music composed using the Vuzik interface.},

AuRal is an environmental audio system in which individual participants form ad hoc ensembles based on geolocation and affect the overall sound of the music associated with the location that they are in.
The AuRal environment binds physical location and the choices of multiple, simultaneous performers to act as the generative force of music tied to the region. Through a mobile device interface, musical participants, or agents, have a degree of input into the generated music essentially defining the sound of a given region. The audio landscape is superimposed onto the physical one. The resultant musical experience is not tied simply to the passage of time, but through the incorporation of participants over time and spatial proximity, it becomes an aural location as much as a piece of music. As a result, walking through the same location at different times results in unique collaborative listening experiences.},

This paper discusses the notion of interface in public (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors' Sculpture by the Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper on the topic of interface and `site' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context, and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces, art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants, acoustics play a significant role.},

The seeing group, on its part, focused more on the technological instruments applied in the performance, the performer herself and her actions. This study also shows that there were only minor differences between the groups regarding the experience of skill and control, and argues that this observation can be explained by earlier research on skill in NIMEs.},

This work proposes to examine therelations between composers and performers in the contextof the new interfaces for musical expression. It aims to define a theoretical and methodological framework clarifyingthese relations. In this project, this paper is the first experimental study about the use of physical models as gesturalmaps for the production of textural sounds.},

Second, this interaction isn't direct but goes through a high level of abstraction: dancer's emotional expression is recognized and is the source of music generation.

These voltages are used to control complex sound engines in an analogue modular synthesizer. Both the voltage field and the tap electrodes can be moved freely. The design was inspired by previous research in complex mappings for advanced digital instruments, and provides a similarly dynamic playing environment for analogue synthesis. The interface is cheap to build, and provides flexible control over a large set of parameters. It is musically satisfying to play, and allows for a wide range of playing techniques, from wild exploration to subtle expressions. I also present an inven-tory of the available playing techniques, motivated by the interface design, musically, conceptually and theatrically. The performance aspects of the interface are also discussed. The interface has been used in a number of performances in Sweden and Japan in 2011, and is also used by other musicians.},

  Abstract                 = {Performing music with a computer and loudspeakers represents always a challenge. The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand, the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological signals of the human body and physical performance.
The present article tackles this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping techniques and their sonic outcome.},

It differs most notably from the majority of ventures into the design of novel musical in-terfaces and installations in its multidisciplinary approach, draw-ing on techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, social sci-ences and ludology. Our User-Centered Design methodology was central to producing an interactive environment that enhances tra-ditional performance with novel functionalities. During a formal experiment, musicians reported finding our system exciting and enjoyable. We also introduce some additional interactions that can further enhance the interactivity of our reactive environment. In describing the particular challenges of working with such a unique and creative user as the musician, we hope that our approach can be of guidance to interface developers working on applications of a creative nature.},

The approach uses dynamic aspects of vocal sound to control variations in the timbre of the synthesized sound. The mapping from vocal to synthesis parameters is automatically adapted to information extracted from vocal examples as well as to the relationship between parameters and timbre within the synthesizer. The mapping strategy aims to maximize the breadth of the explorable perceptual sonic space over a set of the synthesizer's real-valued parameters, indirectly driven by the voice-controlled interface.},

Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change. Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a novel music control sensate surface, which enables integration between any musical instruments with a v ersatile, customizable, and essentially cost-effective user interface. This sensate surface is based on c onductive inkjet printing technology which allows capacitive sensor electrodes and connections between electronics components to be printed onto a large roll of flexible substrate that is unrestricted in length. The high dynamic range capacitive sensing electrodes can not only infer touch, but near-range, non-contact gestural nuance in a music performance. With this sensate surface, users can ``cut'' out their desired shapes, ``paste'' the number of inputs, and customize their controller interface, which can then send signals wirelessly to effects or software synthesizers. We seek to find a solution for integrating the form factor of traditional music controllers seamlessly on top of one's music instrument and meanwhile adding expressiveness to the music performance by sensing and incorporating movements and gestures to manipulate the musical output. We present an example of implementation on an electric ukulele and provide several design examples to demonstrate the versatile capabilities of this system.},

  Abstract                 = {From a technical point of view, instrumental music mak-ing involves audible, visible and hidden playing parameters. Hidden parameters like force, pressure and fast movements, happening within milliseconds are particularly difficult to capture. Here, we present data focusing on movement coordination parameters of the left hand fingers with the bow hand in violinists and between two violinists in group playing. Data was recorded with different position sensors, a micro camcorder fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow's position, rotation and angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger, the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists was made to see the time differences between two musicians while playing together. For simple integration of a conventional violin into electronic music environments, left hand sensor data were exemplary converted to MIDI and OSC.},

The sound systems adapted to how a team of two players improvised and made a melody together in an interleaved fashion: Systems A and B used a fuzzy logic algorithm and pattern recognition to respond with modifications of a background rhythms. In an experiment with a pen tablet interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue each other's melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is based on ''listening applications''.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides an overview of a new method for approaching beat sequencing. As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.},

These characteristics allow for the easy implementation of varying approaches to collaborative performance. Ensembles who utilize digital musical instruments provide a fertile environment for the design, testing, and utilization of collaborative performance systems.
The three strategies discussed in this paper are the parameterization of musical elements, turn-based collaborative control of sound, and the interaction of musical systems created by multiple performers. Design principles, implementation, and a performance using these strategies are discussed, and the conclusion is drawn that performer interaction and collaboration as a primary focus for system design, composition, and performance is viable.},

Traditionally, musical applications for touch surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However, recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor' to create a local coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship, and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method has only been implemented on Apple computer's small capacitive touch pads. Additionally, there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces [1].},

We applied up-and-down movement of the solenoid-units and user's intuitive input to musical interface. Using transformation of the physical interface, we can apply movement of the units to new interaction design. At the same time we intend to suggest a new interface whose movement itself can attract the user.},

Thanks to this residency, her ongoing long-distance collaboration with the team since 2007 dramatically accelerated, and led to solving several compositional and calibration issues of the Gesture Follower (GF) [2]. Kimura was also the first artist to develop projects between the two teams at IRCAM, using OMAX (Musical Representation Team) with GF.

While respiration is frequently considered as an indicator of the metabolic state of human body that contains meaningful information for medicine or psychology, motional aspect of respiration has been relatively unnoticed in spite of its strong correlation with muscles and the brain.
This paper introduces an interactive system to control music playback for dance performances based on the respiration pattern of the dancer. A wireless wearable sensor device detects the dancer's respiration, which is then utilized to modify the dynamic of music. Two different respiration-dynamic mappings were designed and evaluated through public performances and private tests by professional choreographers. Results from this research suggest a new conceptual approach to musical applications of respiration based on the technical characteristics of music and dance.},

Gestural movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between the sticks while the hand holding TedStick can fo-cus purely on controlling the sound manipulation and effects parameters.},

In this paper we present key questions driving the research, theoretical background, artistic research approach and user research activities.
In the DIYSE project a proof-of-concept music creation system prototype was developed in a collaborative design setting. The prototype provides means to the performer to create music with minimum effort while allowing for versatile interaction. We argue that by using an artistic research approach specifically targeting designing for aesthetic experience we were able to transform the knowledge from early design ideas to resulting technology products in which model's of interaction metaphors, expression and style are in an apparent role.},

MASD helps novice musicians in three ways. It removes the confusion that results from page turns, aides a musician's return to the proper location in the music score after the looking at the conductor and notifies musicians of conductor instructions. MASD is currently verified by evaluating the time between sending beats or conductor information and this information being rendered for the musician. Future work includes user testing of this system.
There are three major components to the MASD system. These components are Score Distribution, Score Rendering and Information Distribution. Score Distribution passes score information to clients and is facilitated by the Internet Communication Engine (ICE). Score Rendering uses the GUIDO Library to display the musical score. Information Distribution uses ICE and the IceStorm service to pass beat and instruction information to musicians.},

This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance. A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical use --the XY pad and button grid --illustrates the manner in which the implicit characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a philosophy of design around them.

Useful mappings for a particular application may be complex in nature, with one or more inputs being linked to one or more outputs. Existing development environments are commonly used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs. This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats. It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch screen. Potential uses therefore include real-time mapping during performance in a more expressive manner than facilitated by existing tools.},

The SABRe projects intention is to be neither tied to its inventors nor to one single player but to offer a reference design for a larger community of bass clarinet players and composers. For this purpose, several instruments are made available and a number of composer residencies, workshops, presentations and concerts are organized. These serve for evaluation and improvement purposes in order to build a robust and user friendly extended musical instrument, that opens new playing modalities.},

The MIDI data is used to control external vocal effects units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another. The result is a hybrid microphone-musical instrument which has recieved extremely positive results from vocalists in numerous infor-mal workshops.},

The interesting outcome of such an examination is that the actual instrument is the space of sound characteristics, through which the performer navigates with gestures captured by various input devices.

A single-note proof of concept for electromagnetic control over this vibrating mechanism was presented at NIME 2011.
In the past year, virtually every aspect of the system has been improved. We use a different vibration sensor that is immune to electromagnetic interference, thus eliminat-ing troublesome feedback. For control, we both reduce cost and gain continuous position sensing throughout the entire range of key motion in addition to aftertouch pressure. Finally, the entire system now fits within the space constraints presented by the original piano, allowing it to be installed on adjacent notes.},

  Abstract                 = {Hyper-instruments extend traditional acoustic instruments with sensing technologies that capture digitally subtle and sophisticated aspects of human performance. They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments. Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer. This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.},

In all three of these cases, detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured in real-time. We describe a direct sensing apparatus that can be used to achieve this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic transcription and help create a ``surrogate'' sensor.

Using this mapping layer, we conducted user studies comparing controlling the model muscle activations using a 2D set of force sensors with a position controlled kinematic input space that maps directly to the sound. Preliminary user evaluation suggests that it was more difficult to using force input but the resultant output sound was more intelligible and natural compared to the kinematic controller. This result shows that force input is a potentially feasible for browsing through a vowel space for an articulatory voice synthesis system, although further evaluation is required.},

However, during the course of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators. The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested. Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones, especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices for music and other applications.},

AVIEM primarily consists of separate audio and visual libraries and grows with user contribution as users explore different combinations between them. The library provides a wide range of experimentation possibilities by allowing users to create audiovisual relations and logging their emotional responses through its interface. Besides being a resourceful tool of experimentation, AVIEM aims to become a source of inspiration, where digitally created abstract virtual environments and soundscapes can elicit target emotions at a preconscious level, by building genuine audiovisual relations that would engage the viewer on a strong emotional stage. Lastly, various schemes are proposed to visualize information extracted through AVIEM, to improve the navigation and designate the trends and dependencies among audiovisual relations.},

Participants can easily create simple sound compositions in real time by collaboratively operating physical artifacts as sound controllers. The physical configuration of the artifacts requires coordinated actions between participants to control sound (thus requiring, and emphasizing collaboration).
Simpletones encourages playful human-to-human interaction by introducing a simple interface and a set of basic rules [1]. This enables novices to focus on the collaborative aspects of making music as a group (such as synchronization and taking collective decisions through non-verbal communication) to ultimately engage a state of group flow[2].
This project is relevant to a contemporary discourse on musical expression because it allows novices to experience the social aspects of group music making, something that is usually reserved only for trained performers [3].},
