This allows us to readily distribute softwareto each laptop in the orchestra depending on the laptop'sinternal configuration, its role in the composition, and theplayer assigned to that computer.

We have made an open installation, where users can perform a variety of actions in several situations. By using the abilities of the computer, we have made an installation, which can be interpreted to have many roles. It can both be an instrument, a co-musician, a communication partner, a toy, a meeting place and an ambient musical landscape. The users can dynamically shift between roles, based on their abilities, knowledge and motivation. },

The experiment is based onsound stimuli corresponding to "causal" and "non-causal"sounds. It is divided into a performance phase and an interview. The experiment is designed to investigate possiblecorrelation between the perception of the "causality" of environmental sounds and different gesture strategies for thesound embodiment. In analogy with the perception of thesounds' causality, we propose to distinguish gestures that"mimic" a sound's cause and gestures that "trace" a sound'smorphology following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that, first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action at theorigin of the sound and participants mimic this action. Second, non-causal sounds lead to inconsistent metaphoric descriptions of the sound and participants make gestures following sound "contours". Quantitatively, the results showthat gesture variability is higher for causal sounds that noncausal sounds.},

We conducted a participatory design study that focused on the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a technology probe that connects users' hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically. },

  Abstract                 = {Popular music (characterized by improvised instrumental parts, beat and measure-level organization, and steady tempo) poses challenges for human-computer music performance (HCMP). Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation. There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking, tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music performance by computer. },

The objective behind the design of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play that the game engine did not account for.

First, within a historical context, a general absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral. Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda. },

  Abstract                 = {We developed a kinetic particles synthesizer for mobile devices having a multi-touch screen such as a tablet PC and a smart phone. This synthesizer generates music based on the kinetics of particles under a two-dimensional physics engine. The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction, restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated. A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone. However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment. },

Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following, but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues. To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software abstractions for synchronization and coordination of music and interfaces in different modalities. We describe these new software structures, present examples, and introduce the idea of music notation as an interactive musical interface rather than a static document. },

Performance and motivation variables wereassessed in an experiment involving a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs ofparticipants used two methods for sound creation: implicitinteraction through physiological signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The resultsshowed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence and more symmetric control thanthe Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware of it.

  Abstract                 = {The use of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental arts is not a novel concept. Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of, sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However, since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one's mental state. Secondly, few such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost, commercially available robotics hardware. },

  Abstract                 = {Many performers of novel musical instruments find it difficult to engage audiences beyond those in the field. Previousresearch points to a failure to balance complexity with usability, and a loss of transparency due to the detachmentof the controller and sound generator. The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience's lack of prior exposure to theinstrument and its workings.However, we argue that there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are intendedto be both a tool for creative expression and a creative workof art in themselves, resulting in incompatible requirements.By considering the instrument, the composition and theperformance together as a whole with careful considerationof the rate of learning demanded of the audience, we propose that a lack of transparency can become an asset ratherthan a hindrance. Our approach calls for not only controllerand sound generator to be designed in sympathy with eachother, but composition, performance and physical form too.Identifying three design principles, we illustrate this approach with the Serendiptichord, a wearable instrument fordancers created by the ,

A magnetic pickup system is mounted to the end of the fiddle's fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded in the body of the instrument back to the pickup. },

Threemain percussive instrument designs were executed using acombination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original, the sound andtravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a massive new sound palette with new scales beyondthe quirky traditional tuning and non-traditional sounds.It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally taughttradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a previously large and heavy ensemble, creatingopportunities for wider audiences to experience Gong Kebyar's enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness inBalinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles,Elek Trika challenges performers to trust silent instrumentsand develop an understanding of highly intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, butthrough the sound of the whole.},

In all of the works, the EGGS principles of simplicity based on the correspondence between elementary sonic and movement units, and of organicity between sound and gesture are applied. Indeed, we study both sound as a means for gesture representation and gesture as embodiment of sound. These principles constitute our guidelines for the investigation of the bidirectional relationship between sound and body expression with various strategies involving both educated and non-educated executors. },

The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance. In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing, sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia musical performance piece. },

Such qualities are the density of the generated events per bar, the amount of variation in generation, the amount of syncopation, the metrical strength, and of course the meter itself. The kin.rhythmicator software application was developed to implement this algorithm. During a performance with the kin.rhythmicator the user can control all aspects of the performance through descriptive and intuitive graphic controls. },

These games provide MIDIequipped controllers that look like their real-world counterparts (e.g. MIDI guitar, MIDI drumkit) that the users playto control their designated avatar in the game. The performance of the user is measured against a score that needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking.

This opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed atARTeM [2]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player, toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that would disturb the performer. Weused those sensors in several performances with a dancingviola player and in one where she was simultaneously controlling gas flames interactively.

This paper presents results from a preliminary user study conducted to evaluate the effect of visual feedback on a musical tracking task. Participants generated a musical signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter, but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously decreases performance in both dimensions. },

  Abstract                 = {Recently, Microsoft introduced a game interface called Kinect for the Xbox 360 video game platform. This interface enables users to control and interact with the game console without the need to touch a controller. It largely increases the users' degree of freedom to express their emotion. In this paper, we first describe the system we developed to use this interface for sound generation and controlling musical expression. The skeleton data are extracted from users' motions and the data are translated to pre-defined MIDI data. We then use the MIDI data to control several applications. To allow the translation between the data, we implemented a simple Kinect-to-MIDI data convertor, which is introduced in this paper. We describe two applications to make music with Kinect: we first generate sound with Max/MSP, and then control the adlib with our own adlib generating system by the body movements of the users. },

These choreographiescould include spectators too, providing them with the possibility to directly modify the scene and its audio/visual features. We also introduce the first interactive performancestaged with this technology, in which an electronic musician played live five tracks manipulating the 3D projectedvisuals. As questionnaires have been distributed after theshow, in the last part of this work we discuss the analysisof collected data, underlining positive and negative aspectsof the proposed experience.This paper belongs together with a performance proposalcalled Dissonance, in which two performers exploit the platform to create a progressive soundtrack along with the exploration of an interactive virtual environment.},
