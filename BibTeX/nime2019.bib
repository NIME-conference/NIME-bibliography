  abstract = {This paper reports on a workshop where participants produced physical mock-ups of musical interfaces directly after miming control of short electroacoustic music pieces. Our goal was understanding how people envision and materialize their own sound-producing gestures from spontaneous cognitive mappings. During the workshop, 50 participants from different creative backgrounds modeled more than 180 physical artifacts. Participants were filmed and interviewed for the later analysis of their different multimodal associations about music. Our initial hypothesis was that most of the physical mock-ups would be similar to the sound-producing objects that participants would identify in the musical pieces. Although the majority of artifacts clearly showed correlated design trajectories, our results indicate that a relevant number of participants intuitively decided to engineer alternative solutions emphasizing their personal design preferences. Therefore, in this paper we present and discuss the workshop format, its results and the possible applications for designing new musical interfaces.}

The automatic harp can play music based on the electronic score and change its speed according to the speed of the performer. We built a 32-channel automatic harp and designed a layered modular framework integrating both hardware and software, for experimental real-time control protocols. Considering that MIDI keyboard lacking information of force (acceleration) and fingering detection, both of which are important for expression, we designed force-sensor glove and achieved basic image recognition. They are used to accurately detect speed, force (corresponding to velocity in MIDI) and pitch when a performer plays the piano.}

This work describes an electromechanical system for incorporating frequency and amplitude modulation to the Symbaline’s sound. A pendulum having a magnetic bob is suspended inside the liquid in the wine glass. The pendulum is put into oscillation by driving infra-sound signals through the coil. The pendulum's movement causes the liquid in the glass to slosh back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass sounds are produced by driving audio-range signals through the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to the glass surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the glass vibrates, the sloshing liquid periodically changes the glass's resonance frequencies and dampens the glass, thus modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.}

Each button can be mapped to a set of MIDI notes or control parameters. The sound is generated through synthesis or sample playback and can be amplified with the help of a transducer, which excites the resonance box. An essential contribution of this interface is the possibility of reconfiguration of the buttons layout without the need to hard rewire the system since it uses only the smartphone built-in camera. This features allow for quick instrument customisation for different use cases,
such as low cost projects for schools or instrument building  workshops. Our case study used the Sibilim for music education, where it was designed to develop the conscious of music perception and to stimulate creativity through exercises of short tonal musical compositions. We conducted a study with a group of twelve participants in an experimental workshop to verify its validity.

Then we perform three complementary tests on BLE MIDI and alternative interfaces using prototype and commercial devices, showing that BLE MIDI has comparable performance with the tested WiFi implementations, with end-to-end (sensor input to audio output) latencies of under 10ms under certain conditions. Overall, BLE MIDI is an ideal choice for controllers and sensor interfaces that are designed to work on a wide variety of platforms.}

  abstract = {Although several Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been presented at NIME, very few of them remain accessible to the community. Rebuilding a DMI is often a necessary step to allow for performance with NIMEs. Rebuilding a DMI exactly similar to its original, however, might not be possible due to technology obsolescence, lack of documentation or other reasons. It might then be interesting to re-interpret a DMI and build an instrument inspired by the original one, creating novel performance opportunities. This paper presents the challenges and approaches involved in rebuilding and re-interpreting an existing DMI, The Sponge by Martin Marier. The rebuilt versions make use of newer/improved technology and customized design aspects like addition of vibrotactile feedback and implementation of different mapping strategies. It also discusses the implications of embedding sound synthesis within the DMI, by using the Prynth framework and further presents a comparison between this approach and the more traditional ground-up approach. As a result of the evaluation and comparison of the two rebuilt DMIs, we present a third version which combines the benefits and discuss performance issues with these devices.}

The performer controls a bank of 64 virtual inter-connected resonating strings, with individual and direct control of tuning and resonance characteristics through a multitouch-enhanced klavier interface (TouchKeys). It is a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument, as all string vibrations originate from physical vibrations in the klavier and its casing, captured through contact microphones. In addition, there are gestural strings, called ropes, excited by performed musical gestures. All strings and ropes are connected, and inter-resonate together as a ”super-harp”, internally and through the performance space. With strong resonance, strings may go into chaotic motion or emergent quasi-periodic patterns, but custom adaptive leveling mechanisms keep loudness under the musician's control at all times. The hybrid digital/acoustic approach and the enhanced keyboard provide for an expressive and very physical interaction, and a strong multi-channel immersive experience. The paper describes the aesthetic choices behind the design of the system, as well as the technical implementation, and – primarily – the interaction design, as it emerges from mapping, sound design, physical modeling and integration of the acoustic, the gestural, and the virtual. The work is evaluated based on the experiences from a series of performances.}

Specifically, these are instruments that are physical in that they use bodily interaction, take advantage of the physical affordances of the laptop. They are embodied in the sense that instruments are played in such ways where the sound is embedded to be close to the instrument. Three distinct laptop instruments, Taptop, Armtop, and Blowtop, are introduced in this paper. We discuss the integrity of the design process with composing for laptop instruments and performing with them. In this process, our aim is to blur the boundaries of the composer and designer/engineer roles. How the physicality is achieved by leveraging musical gestures gained through traditional instrument practice is studied, as well as those inspired by body gestures. We aim to explore how using such interaction methods affects the communication between the ensemble and the audience. An aesthetic-first qualitative evaluation of these interfaces is discussed, through works and performances crafted specifically for these instruments and presented in the concert setting of the laptop orchestra. In so doing, we reflect on how such physical, embodied instrument design practices can inform a different kind of expressive and performance mindset.}

The proposed method was used to stage an artistic show in which a Soundpainter had to improvise with 6 different gestures to generate a musical composition from different sounds in real time. The accuracy of the gesture recognition system was evaluated as well as Soundpainter's user experience. In addition, a user evaluation study for using our proposed system in a learning context was also conducted. Current results open up perspectives for the design of new artistic expressions based on the use of automatic gestural recognition supported by Soundpainting language.}

The paper presents three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate the guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which 11 guitarists tested the Magpick for five days and composed a piece with it. Reflecting on their comments and experiences, we outline the innovative features of this technology from the point of view of performance practice. In particular, compared to other augmentations, the high temporal resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the Magpick support a highly nuanced control over the sound. Our discussion highlights the utility of having the locus of augmentation coincide with the locus of interaction.}

The music composer creates beforehand musical elements such as melodic patterns, sound patterns, instruments, group of instruments, and a dynamic score that governs the way the basic elements will behave according to events produced by the audience. During the concert or the performance, the audience, by interacting with the system, gives birth to an original music composition. Skini music scores are expressed in terms of constraints that establish relationships between instruments. A constraint maybe instantaneous, for instance one may disable violins while trumpets are playing. A constraint may also be temporal, for instance, the piano cannot play more than 30 consecutive seconds. The Skini platform is implemented in Hop.js and HipHop.js. HipHop.js, a synchronous reactive DLS, is used for implementing the music scores as its elementary constructs consisting of high level operators such as parallel executions, sequences, awaits, synchronization points, etc, form an ideal core language for implementing Skini constraints. This paper presents the Skini platform. It reports about live performances and an educational project. It briefly overviews the use of HipHop.js for representing score.}

This work aims the elaboration of a strategy in which several gestures performed in a joystick control can influence one or several parameters of the sound synthesis, making a mapping denominated many to many. Buttons combinations used to perform game actions that are common in fighting games, like Street Fighter, were mapped to the synthesizer to create a music. Experiments show that this mapping is capable of influencing the musical expression of a DMI making it closer to an acoustic instrument.}

Several DDMI have already been created, but they have been developed isolatedly, and there is still a lack of a common process of ideation and development. Knowledge about Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) and Interactive Dance Systems (IDSs) can contribute to the design of DDMI, but the former brings few contributions to the body's expressiveness, and the latter brings few references to an instrumental relationship with music. Because of those different premises, the integration between both paradigms can be an arduous task for the designer of DDMI. The conceptual framework of DDMI can also serve as a bridge between DMIs and IDSs, serving as a lingua franca between both communities and facilitating the exchange of knowledge. The conceptual framework has shown to be a promising analytical tool for the design, development, and evaluation of new digital dance and music instrument.}

The authors highlight the importance of the performers perspective when using design as a means for overcoming access barriers to music. Also, while the authors were not able to find an ideal solution for the musician within the confines of this study, several useful observations on the process of evaluating bespoke assistive music technology are described; observations which may prove useful to digital musical instrument designers working within the field of inclusive music.}

  abstract = {T-Voks is an augmented theremin that controls Voks, a performative singing synthesizer. Originally developed for control with a graphic tablet interface, Voks allows for real-time pitch and time scaling, vocal effort modification and syllable sequencing for pre-recorded voice utterances. For T-Voks the theremin’s frequency antenna modifies the output pitch of the target utterance while the amplitude antenna controls not only volume as usual but also voice quality and vocal effort. Syllabic sequencing is handled by an additional pressure sensor attached to the player’s volume-control hand. This paper presents the system architecture of T-Voks, the preparation procedure for a song, playing gestures, and practice techniques, along with musical and poetic examples across four different languages and styles.}

Our acoustic evaluation shows drum rolls executed by DRMMR easily exhibit greater levels of regularity, speed, and precision than comparable transducer and electromagnetic-based actuation methods. DRMMR's nonlinear acoustic synthesis functionality also presents possibilities for new kinds of sonic interactions on the surface of drum membranes.}

In the current paper, we report on an online survey in which music technologists were asked to speculate on the background of the musicians who designed particular instruments. Our results showed several cues for the interpretation of the artefacts' origins, including physical features, body-instrument interactions, use of language and references to established music practices and tools. Tacit musical and cultural values were also identified based on intuitive and holistic judgments. Our discussion highlights the importance of cultural awareness and context-dependent values on the design and use of interactive musical systems.}

We have recently seen various improvements of interface design on tactile feedback and force guidance aiming to make instrument learning more effective. However, most interfaces are still quite static; they cannot yet sense the learning progress and adjust the tutoring strategy accordingly. To solve this problem, we contribute an adaptive haptic interface based on the latest design of haptic flute. We first adopted a clutch mechanism to enable the interface to turn on and off the haptic control flexibly in real time. The interactive tutor is then able to follow human performances and apply the “teacher force” only when the software instructs so. Finally, we incorporated the adaptive interface with a step-by-step dynamic learning strategy. Experimental results showed that dynamic learning dramatically outperforms static learning, which boosts the learning rate by 45.3% and shrinks the forgetting chance by 86%.

These sensors each perform better or worse depending on the class of gesture the user is making, motivating sensor fusion practices. Residuals between Kalman filters and sensor output are calculated and used as input to a recurrent neural network which outputs a classification that determines which processing parameters and sensor measurements are employed. Multiple instances (30) of layer recurrent neural networks with a single hidden layer varying in size from 1 to 10 processing units were trained, and tested on previously unseen data. The best performing neural network has only 3 hidden units and has a sufficiently low error rate to be good candidate for gesture classification. This paper demonstrates that: dynamic networks out-perform feedforward networks for this type of gesture classification, a small network can handle a problem of this level of complexity, recurrent networks of this size are fast enough for real-time applications of this type, and the importance of training multiple instances of each network architecture and selecting the best performing one from within that set.}

Movement is tracked and mapped through extensive pre-processing to a high-dimensional acoustic space, using a many-to-many mapping, so that every small body movement matters. Designed for improvised exploration, it works as both performance and installation. Through this re-translation of bodily action, position, and posture into infinite-dimensional sound texture and timbre, the performers are invited to re-think and re-learn position and posture as sound, effort as gesture, and timbre as a bodily construction. The sound space can be shared by two people, with added modes of presence, proximity and interaction. The aesthetic background and technical implementation of the system are described, and the system is evaluated based on a number of performances, workshops and installation exhibits. Finally, the aesthetic and choreographic motivations behind the performance narrative are explained, and discussed in the light of the design of the sonification.}

A small scale review covers systems from two prominent UK-based companies, and two itera- tions of a new prototype system that were developed in collaboration with a small group of young people on the autistic spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects of musical experience that are made accessible differ with re- spect to the extent and nature of each system’s constraints. It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype system facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques observed during its development. Based on these obser- vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni- ties for the emergence of personal practices and preferences in neurodiverse groups of children and young people, and that this is a fitting subject for further research.}

The application enables music creation in a specific expanded format: four separate mono tracks, each one able to manipulate up to eight audio samples per channel. It works also as a performance instrument that stimulates collaborative remixings from compositions of scored interaction gestures called “scenes”. The interface also aims to be a platform to exchange those sample packs as artistic releases, a format similar to the popular idea of an “album”, but prepared to those four channel packs of samples and scores of interaction. It uses an adaptive audio slicing mechanism and it is based on interaction design for multi-touch screen features. A timing sequencer enhances the interaction between pre-set sequences (the “scenes”) and screen manipulation scratching, expanding and moving graphic sound waves. This paper describes the graphical interface features, some development decisions up to now and perspectives to its continuity.

These are produced by a neural network that ensures that (with high probability) the melodic and rhythmic structure of the new melody is consistent with a given set of sample songs. We train a Variational Autoencoder network to identify a low-dimensional set of variables that allows for the compression and representation of sample songs. By perturbing these variables with Perlin Noise---a temporally-consistent parameterized noise function---it is possible to generate smoothly-changing novel melodies. We show that (1) by regulating the amount of noise, one can specify how much of the base song will be preserved; and (2) there is a direct correlation between the noise signal and the differences between the statistical properties of novel melodies and the original one. Users can interpret the controllable noise as a type of "creativity knob": the higher it is, the more leeway the network has to generate significantly different melodies. We present a physical prototype that allows musicians to use a keyboard to provide base melodies and to adjust the network's "creativity knobs" to regulate in real-time the process that proposes new melody ideas.}

We build upon previous work in sound-tracing and mapping-by-demonstration to ask the participants to design gestures with which to perform the given sounds using a multimodal, inertial measurement (IMU) and muscle sensing (EMG) device. We presented the user with four techniques for associating sensor input to synthesizer parameter output. Two were classical techniques from the literature, and two proposed different ways to capture dynamic gesture in a neural network. These four techniques were: 1.) A Static Position regression training procedure, 2.) A Hidden Markov based temporal modeler, 3.) Whole Gesture capture to a neural network, and 4.) a Windowed method using the position-based procedure on the fly during the performance of a dynamic gesture. Our results show trade-offs between accurate, predictable reproduction of the source sounds and exploration of the gesture-sound space. Several of the users were attracted to our new windowed method for capturing gesture anchor points on the fly as training data for neural network based regression. This paper will be of interest to musicians interested in going from sound design to gesture design and offers a workflow for quickly trying different mapping-by-demonstration techniques.

Using a participatory design approach, we worked with sonification as a tool for systematically exploring the dancer's bodily expressions. The exploration used a "spatiotemporal matrix," with a particular focus on sonic microinteraction. In the final performance, two Myo armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the arm and leg of the dancer, together with a wireless headset microphone capturing the sound of breathing. In the paper we reflect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our approach to creating a shared instrument using sonification as a tool for the sound design, and reflect on the performers' subjective evaluation of the instrument.   }

Similarly, the instrument designer, composer, and performer are often the same person. The Academic Festival Overture is a new piece of music for the DMI Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written by a composer who had no prior experience with the instrument. The piece underwent the phases of a composition competition, rehearsals, a music video production, and a public live performance. This whole process was evaluated reflecting on the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the composer, the conductor, and the instrument designer as performer. `Blending dimensions' of these stakeholder and decoupling the composition from the instrument designer inspired the newly involved composer to completely rethink the DMI's interaction and sound concept. Thus, to deliberately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer and a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and at the same time the challenge to seek such a collaboration in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings and improvement.}

The proposed system is based on a natural language processing technique: word-based sequence-to-sequence learning using LSTM units. The novelty of the proposed method lies in the fact that the system is not reliant on a voice-by-voice transcription of drums; instead, in this method, a drum representation is used as an input sequence from which a translated bassline is obtained at the output. The drum representation consists of fixed size sequences of onsets detected from a 2-bar audio drum loop in eight different frequency bands. The basslines generated by this method consist of pitched notes with different duration. The proposed system was trained on two distinct datasets compiled for this project by the authors. Each dataset contains a variety of 2-bar drum loops with annotated basslines from two different styles of dance music: House and Soca. A listening experiment designed based on the system revealed that the proposed system is capable of generating basslines that are interesting and are well rhythmically interlocked with the drum loops from which they were generated.

The workshop is designed for master students with multidisciplinary backgrounds. They are encouraged to work in teams from two university campuses remotely connected through a portal space. The components of the workshop are prototyping, music improvisation and reflective practice. We report the results of this course, which show a positive impact on the students' confidence in prototyping and intention to continue in STEM fields. We also present the challenges and lessons learned on how to improve the teaching of hybrid technologies and programming skills in an interdisciplinary context across two locations, with the aim of satisfying both beginners and experts. We conclude with a broader discussion on how these new pedagogical perspectives can improve NIME-related courses.}

These improvisations have been recorded using Motion Capture, in order to develop interfaces for co-located and telematic interactions for the sharing of narratives of migration. In this paper, using data from the Motion Capture experiments, we are exploring two specific movements from improvisers: displacements on space (walking, rotating), and breathing data.

Users can point anywhere to interact with the system, and the spatial interaction utilizes motion capture, so it does not require a screen. Instead, it is completely controlled via hand gestures using a glove that is populated with motion-tracking markers.

The main purpose of this system is to offer intuitive physical interaction with the perimeter-based spatial sound sources. Further, its goal is to minimize user-worn technology and thereby enhance freedom of motion by utilizing environmental sensing devices, such as motion capture cameras or infrared sensors. The ensuing creativity enabling technology is applicable to a broad array of possible scenarios, from researching limits of human spatial hearing perception to facilitating learning and artistic performances, including dance. In this paper, we describe our NIME design and implementation, its preliminary assessment, and offer a Unity-based toolkit to facilitate its broader deployment and adoption.}

Rather than predicting symbolic music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future control data from the user and precise temporal information can lead to new and interesting interactive possibilities. We propose that a mixture density recurrent neural network (MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predictions can be used to fill-in control data when the user stops performing, or as a kind of filter on the user's own input. We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive musical interaction by recording datasets, training MDRNN models, and experimenting with interaction modes. We illustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying this idea. Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive interaction is viable even on single-board computers and that small models are appropriate for small datasets.}

  abstract = {When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is often of interest to retain an instrument's sound quality and nuanced response while leveraging the richness of digital synthesis.  Digital audio has traditionally been generated through speakers, separating sound generation from the instrument itself, or by adding an actuator within the instrument's resonating body, imparting new sounds along with the original.  We offer a third option, isolating the playing interface from the actuated resonating body, allowing us to rewrite the relationship between performance action and sound result while retaining the general form and feel of the acoustic instrument.  We present a hybrid acoustic-electronic violin based on a stick-body electric violin and an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing individual string displacements.  A conventional violin body acts as the resonator, actuated using digitally altered audio of the string inputs.  By attaching the electric violin above the body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical playing experience of a normal violin along with some of the acoustic filtering and radiation of a traditional build.  We propose the use of the hybrid instrument with digitally automated pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for use as a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.}

Also, players make physical motions and, in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians' artistic intentions. However, it's not clear if the sound manipulation reflects in physical motions. The understanding of the musical structure of the work being performed in its many levels may impact the projection of artistic intentions, and performers alter it in micro and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs, phrases and sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing manipulation and how such variations may reflect in physical gestures. The study involved musicians (flute, clarinet, and bassoon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini. We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the Inter Onsets Interval deviations) and physical motion based on the traveled distance of the flute under different conditions. The flutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in three experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing in duets with previous recordings by other instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. The finding suggests that: 1) the movements, which seem to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent and stable, 2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reflects in gestures' amplitude performed by flutists.}

The actual action-sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and processed in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the acoustical domain alone. The control parameters are captured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm proprieties like filter cutoff frequency, frequency shift or overdrive. The instrument opens up the possibility for a large selection of different interaction techniques that have a direct impact on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a sound designer's perspective, encouraging exploration in the materials used as well as techniques. The contribution are two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer to augment the Sensel Morph affords an extra dimension of control on top of the offerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from physical interactions as a source for excitation and manipulation of an audio processing system offers a large variety of new sounds to be discovered. The methodology involved an exploratory process of iterative instrument making, interspersed with observations gathered via improvisatory trials, focusing on the new interactions made possible through the fusion of audio-rate inputs with the Morph's default interaction methods.

In addition, this method does not scale to longer samples that require higher-dimensional descriptions, which biases systems towards the use of short samples. In this paper we propose novel framework for automatic creation of interactive sound spaces from sound collections using feature learning and dimensionality reduction. The framework is implemented as a software library using the SuperCollider language. We compare several algorithms and describe some example interfaces for interacting with the resulting spaces. Our experiments signal the potential of unsupervised algorithms for creating data-driven musical interfaces.}

One part of this challenge is the problem of generating convincing accompaniment parts to a given melody, as could be used in an automatic accompaniment system. Despite much progress in this area, systems that can automatically learn to generate interesting sounding, as well as harmonically plausible, accompanying melodies remain somewhat elusive. In this paper we explore the problem of sequence to sequence music generation where a human user provides a sequence of notes, and a neural network model responds with a harmonically suitable sequence of equal length. We consider two sequence-to-sequence models; one featuring standard unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, and the other featuring bidirectional LSTM, both successfully trained to produce a sequence based on the given input. Both of these are fairly dated models, as part of the investigation is to see what can be achieved with such models. These are evaluated and compared via a qualitative study that features 106 respondents listening to eight random samples from our set of generated music, as well as two human samples. From the results we see a preference for the sequences generated by the bidirectional model as well as an indication that these sequences sound more human.}

  abstract = {Bendit\_I/O is a system that allows for wireless, networked performance of circuit-bent devices, giving artists a new outlet for performing with repurposed technology. In a typical setup, a user pre-bends a device using the Bendit\_I/O board as an intermediary, replacing physical switches and potentiometers with the board’s reed relays, motor driver, and digital potentiometer signals. Bendit\_I/O brings the networking techniques of distributed music performances to the hardware hacking realm, opening the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi- enabled I/O board and a Node-based server, the system provides performers with a variety of interaction and control possibilities between connected users and hacked devices. Moreover, it is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular, making it a flexible toolset for artists of diverse experience levels.}

  abstract = {'Where Is The Quiet?' is a mixed-media installation that utilizes immersive experience design, mechatronics, and machine learning in order to enhance wellness and increase connectivity to the natural world. Individuals interact with the installation by wearing a brainwave interface that measures the strength of the alpha wave signal. The interface then transmits the data to a computer that uses it in order to determine the individual's overall state of relaxation. As the individual achieves higher states of relaxation, mechatronic instruments respond and provide feedback. This feedback not only encourages self-awareness but also it motivates the individual to relax further. Visitors without the headset experience the installation by watching a film and listening to an original musical score. Through the novel arrangement of technologies and features, 'Where Is The Quiet?' demonstrates that mediated technological experiences are capable of evoking meditative states of consciousness, facilitating individual and group connectivity, and deepening awareness of the natural world. As such, this installation opens the door to future research regarding the possibility of immersive experiences supporting humanitarian needs.}

Longevity is generally regarded as a valuable quality that good design criteria should help to achieve. However, the nature of the tools, of the performance conditions and of the music itself may lead to think of ephemerality as an intrinsic modality of the existence of DMIs. In particular, the conditions of contemporary musical production suggest that contextual adaptations of instrumental devices beyond the monolithic unity of classical instruments should be considered. The first two parts of this article analyse various reasons to reassess the issue of longevity and ephemerality. The last two sections attempt to propose an articulation of these two aspects to inform both the design of the DMI and their learning.}

The device audio specifications arose from musicological insights about the social role of performers in their musical contexts and the instruments’ playing techniques. They were taken as design challenges in the creation process of PICO`s first prototype, which was submitted to a short evaluation. Along with the construction of PICO, we reflected over the design of an interactive audio interface as a mode of research.

The theoretical reference approached is linked to the embodied cognition, with unfolding related to the cognitive semantics and the enactivist current of cognitive sciences, among other domains of contemporary sciences of mind and neuroscience. The experiments involve the relationship between music and movement, based on prior research using as a reference context in which it is not possible to establish a clear distinction between them: the Capoeira.

In order to have a better understanding of such performances, Dimension Space Analysis, with its capacity to review multifaceted components of a system, can be applied to telematic performances, understood here as (a bundle of) NIMEs.

Chordophone designs have taken multiple forms, from frames that play a guitar-like instrument, to machines that integrate strings and actuators as part of their frame. However, few of these instruments have taken advantage of dynamics, which have been largely unexplored. This paper details the design and construction of a new picking mechanism prototype which enables expressive techniques through fast and precise movement and actuation. We have adopted iterative design and rapid prototyping strategies to develop and refine a compact picker capable of creating dynamic variations reliably. Finally, a quantitative evaluation process demonstrates that this system offers the speed and consistency of previously existing picking mechanisms, while providing increased control over musical dynamics and articulations.}

Our hypothesis is that using evolutionary algorithms with VR for musical interactions will lead to increased user telepresence. In addition to this, REVOLVE was designed to inform novel research into this unexplored area. Think aloud trials and thematic analysis revealed 5 main themes: control, comparison to the real world, immersion, general usability and limitations, in addition to practical improvements. Overall, it was found that this combination of technologies did improve telepresence levels, proving the original hypothesis correct.}

This paper aims to analyze the technological innovation, aesthetic design process, and impact of Harriet Padberg's original 1964 thesis as well as the design of a modern recreation and utilization, in order to gain insight to the nature of revisiting older works. Here, we present our open source recreation of Padberg's program with a modern interface and, through its use as an artistic tool by three composers, show how historical works can be effectively used for new creative purposes in contemporary contexts. Not Even One by Molly Jones draws on the historical and social significance of Harriet Padberg through using her program in a piece about the lack of representation of women judges in composition competitions. Brevity by Anna Savery utilizes the original software design as a composition tool, and The Padberg Piano by Anthony Caulkins uses the melodic generation of the original to create a software instrument.}

The control mechanism allows the musician to have a varying degree of agency over the overall musical direction. We present interviews and discussions on open-ended experiments conducted with music students and musicians. The outcome of this research includes new modes of playing the guitar given the robotic capabilities, and an understanding of how automation can be integrated into instrument-playing processes. The results present insights into how a human-machine hybrid system can increase the efficacy of training or exploration, without compromising human engagement with a task.}

  abstract = {Modern computer music performances often involve a musical instrument that is primarily digital; software runs on a computer, and the physical form of the instrument is the computer. In such a practice, the performance interface is rendered on a computer screen for the performer. There has been a concern in using a laptop as a musical instrument from the audience's perspective, in that having ``a laptop performer sitting behind the screen'' makes it difficult for the audience to understand how the performer is creating music.  Mirroring a computer screen on a projection screen has been one way to address the concern and reveal the performer's instrument. This paper introduces and discusses the author's computer music practice, in which a performer actively considers screen mirroring as an essential part of the performance, beyond visualization of music. In this case, screen mirroring is not complementary, but inevitable from the inception of the performance. The related works listed within explore various roles of screen mirroring in computer music performance and helps us understand empirical and logistical findings in such practices.}

  abstract = {We present IllumiWear, a novel eTextile prototype that uses fiber optics as interactive input and visual output. Fiber optic cables are separated into bundles and then woven like a basket into a bendable glowing fabric. By equipping light emitting diodes to one side of these bundles and photodiode light intensity sensors to the other, loss of light intensity can be measured when the fabric is bent. The sensing technique of IllumiWear is not only able to discriminate between discreet touch, slight bends, and harsh bends, but also recover the location of deformation. In this way, our computational fabric prototype uses its intrinsic means of visual output (light) as a tool for interactive input. We provide design and implementation details for our prototype as well as a technical evaluation of its effectiveness and limitations as an interactive computational textile. In addition, we examine the potential of this prototype's interactive capabilities by extending our eTextile to create a tangible user interface for audio and visual manipulation.
