The average absolute error in one direction of the sensor was measured to be less than 10% of one of the matrix&#8217;s strips (M = 1.8mm, SD = 1.37mm). We intend this technology to be easy to use and implement by experts and novices alike: We ensure the ease of use by providing a host application that tracks touch points and passes these on as OSC or MIDI messages. We make our design easy to implement by providing open source software and hardware and by choosing evaluation methods that use accessible tools, making quantitative comparisons between different branches of the design easy. We chose to work with textile to take advantage of its tactile properties and its malleability of form and to pay tribute to textile&#8217;s rich cultural heritage. },

Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate and thereby produce sound.  In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet.  For a beginner, this can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air jet and lips position.  This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible and measurable.  The augmented flute shows information about the area covered by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it shows graphically the air jet direction.  Additionally, the augmented flute provides directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced flutists.},

This approach breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to transduce gesture into sonic output.  We outline a method for generating multimodal terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain. We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.},

Two problems are addressed: 1) the sensor cannot detect overlapping hands 2) The sensor's limited detection range. Training examples included 7 kinds of overlapping hand gestures as well as hand trajectories where a hand goes out of the sensor's range. The overlapping gestures were treated as a classification problem and the best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with 62% accuracy. The out-of-range problem was treated first as a clustering problem to group the training examples into a small number of trajectory types, then as a classification problem to predict trajectory type based on the hand's motion before going out of range. The best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with an accuracy of 30%. The prediction models were implemented in an ongoing multimedia electroacoustic vocal performance and an educational project named Embodied Sonic Meditation (ESM).  },

There was an assumption that the core working process would have to include the design of a new musical instrument, which in some cases became the final deliverable of the Studio and in other cases a step in a process that leads to a different outcome (such as an architectural Design, a performance or social experiment). One other relevant aspect was that Digital technology was used in the design and fabrication of the physical instruments&#8217; prototypes, but in very few cases, it was used in the actual generation or enhancement of sound, with the instruments relying almost exclusively in acoustic and mechanical sound.  },

In this study, a model is proposed for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75% mean accuracy.},

Designed in the form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer's muscle movements into control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses. These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals.  The primary goal in designing Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study conducted with 21 professional musicians. A video abstract for Biostomp can be viewed at vimeo.com/biostomp/video.},

The human skeletal data is acquired through a Microsoft Kinect v2.  The movement of the student is mirrored through an abstract skeletal figure and instructions are provided through a virtual teacher.  Posture deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual feedback modality with no feedback leads to an increase in posture accuracy (p &lt; 0.001, Cohen's d = 1.047). Reaction card feedback and expert interviews indicate that the feedback is considered fun and useful for training independently from the teacher.},

Yet, designing for playfulness remains a challenging task, as little knowledge is available for designers to support their decisions.  To address this issue, we follow a design rationale approach using the context of Live Looping (LL) as a case study. We start by surveying 101 LL tools, summarizing our analysis into a new design space. We then use this design space to discuss potential guidelines to address playfulness in a design process. These guidelines are implemented and discussed in a new LL tool&#8212;called the "Voice Reaping Machine". Finally, we contrast our guidelines with previous works in the literature.},

The parameters of the string model are controlled through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping.  The instrument is evaluated from a performing musician's perspective, and emerging playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument, yet with new kinds of control.  The contributions are two-fold. First, the use of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of "inside piano" playing, using multitouch keyboard data, allows for performance techniques going far beyond conventional keyboard playing.},

The loop pedal, is still the most used device for those types of performances, accounting for many of the cover songs performances on youtube, but not all kinds of song apply.  Unlike a common loop pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization.  In its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage, we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints, the new RL deals with pop music and has been already used in several in live concert situations.},

This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally, we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable alternative to classic GPGPU modelling.},

Instrument augmentation is a common approach for designing new interfaces for musical expression, as shown through hyperinstrument research.  New visual affordances present in VR give designers new methods for augmenting instruments to extend not only their expressivity, but also their capabilities for computer assisted tutoring. In this work, we present VRMin, a mobile Mixed Reality (MR) application for augmenting a physical theremin, with an immersive virtual environment (VE), for real time computer assisted tutoring. We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning for performing given notes and volumes.  The physical theremin acts as a domain specific controller for the resulting MR environment.  The initial effectiveness of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer's hand position while training with and without the VRMin. We also evaluate the usability of the interface using heuristic evaluation based on a newly proposed set of guidelines designed for VR musical environments.},

It argues that the conventional model of composer-performer-listener, and the underlying mid-20th century metaphor of music as communication upon which it relies, cannot reflect the richness of interaction and possibility afforded by interactive digital technologies.  Building on Paul Lansky's vision of an expanded and dynamic social network, an alternative, ecological view of music-making is presented, in which meaning emerges not from "messages" communicated between individuals, but instead from the "noise" that arises through the uncertainty in their interactions. However, in our tendency in NIME to collapse the various roles in this network into a single individual, we place the increased potential afforded by digital systems at risk. Using examples from the author's NIME practices, the paper uses a practice-based methodology to describe approaches to designing instruments that respond to the technologies that form the interfaces of the network, which can include scores and stylistic conventions. In doing so, the paper demonstrates that a repertoire&#8212;a seemingly anachronistic concept&#8212;and a corresponding repertoire-driven approach to creating NIMEs can in fact be a catalyst for invention and creativity.},

In this light, the self-perception of the musical HCI and instrument designer can be seen as occupying a primary importance in the instruments and interfaces that eventually come to be created. The work of a designer who self-identifies as an artist may result in a vastly different outcome than one who considers him or herself to be an entrepreneur, or a scientist, for example. These differing definitions of self as well as their HCI outcomes require their own means of critique, understanding and expectations. All too often, these definitions are unclear, or the considerations of overlapping means of critique remain unexamined.},

This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments. The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique characteristics of new instruments to a more established musical identity, providing a shared understanding and a common literature to the community.},

This problem becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces.  Most existing solutions to these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small screens).  Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual objects.  Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces. We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing gestural musical instruments.},

Vokinesis, a system for real-time rhythm and pitch modification and control of singing is presented.  Pitch and vocal effort are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The concept of Syllabic Control Points (SCP) is introduced for timing and rhythm control.  A chain of phonetic syllables have two types of temporal phases : the steady phases, which correspond to the vocalic nuclei, and the transient phases, which correspond to the attacks and/or codas. Thus, syllabic rhythm control methods need transient and steady phases control points, corresponding to the ancient concept of the arsis and thesis is prosodic theory. SCP allow for accurate control of articulation, using hand or feet. In the \emph{Tap mode}, SCP are triggered by pressing and releasing a control button. In the \emph{Fader mode}, continuous variation of the SCP sequencing rate is controlled with expression pedals.  Vokinesis has been tested successfully in musical performances, using both syllabic rhythm control modes. This system opens new musical possibilities, and can be extended to other types of sounds beyond voice. },

Thus we describe the didgeridoo excitation signal, how to replicate it, and the hardware necessary to make an electro-acoustic didgeridoo driven by speakers and controllable from a computer. To properly drive the didgeridoo we rely upon 4th-order ported bandpass speaker boxes to help guide our excitation signals into an attached acoustic didgeridoo. The results somewhat replicate human didgeridoo playing, enabling a new kind of mid to low electro-acoustic accompaniment without the need for circular breathing.  },

This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters.  A series of sound stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance. Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument they are given.  Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus.  The dataset created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define mappings for real-time performance.  To better illustrate each step of the procedure, we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor armbands, and waveguide synthesis.},

In this article we describe the hardware and software implementation of sound synthesis for this system, and the implications for design of media for this context.},

  abstract =	 {An important part of electronic dance music (EDM) is the so-called beat.  It is defined by the drum track of the piece and is a style defining element.  While producing EDM, creating the drum track tends to be delicate, yet labor intensive work.  In this work we present a touch-interface-based prototype with the goal to simplify this task.  The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances.  Starting with a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated.  The interface provides simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns.  Variations are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library.  To evaluate the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in EDM production was conducted.  It was found that participants responded positively to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns.  Furthermore, the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations and live performances.},

In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service. The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the 60's physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming videos from the platform as musical materials in computer music and introduce a live coding environment that we developed for real-time improvisation.  },

The performer interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay under the performer's fingertips.  The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2.  The nature of the JoyStyx construction causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry, leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more ``analog'' or ``natural'' sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert, the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.},

Many of these papers have focused on the technical description of how these instruments have been produced, or as in the case of Machover&#8217;s #8216;Hyperinstruments&#8217; [19], on producing instruments over which performers have &#8216;absolute control&#8217; and emphasise &#8216;learnability. perfectibility and repeatability&#8217; [19]. In contrast to this approach, this paper outlines a philosophical position concerning the relationship between instruments and performers in improvisational contexts that recognises the agency of the instrument within the performance process. It builds on a post-phenomenological understanding of the human/instrument relationship in which the human and the instrument are understood as co-defining entities without fixed boundaries; an approach that actively challenges notions of instrumental mastery and &#8216;absolute control&#8217;. This paper then takes a practice-based approach to outline how such philosophical concerns have fed into the design of an augmented, actuated cello system, The Feral Cello, that has been designed to explicitly explore these concerns through practice.  },

Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to refer to this category. There are no "plug-n-play" solutions for a BCMI, these kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial expressions, from the user's brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the device's adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also question its reliability and robustness.},

A robotic hi-hat should be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians to use.  This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously calibrate the hi-hat's action both before and during a musical performance. This is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware, and embedded software algorithms.  This new approach allows musicians to create expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment. },

Six experienced musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance. Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music may not fit with performers' true intentions. It was also found that when external musical material is introduced to guide the performers into a collective convergence, it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out of context.},

This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the effect pedals anywhere on the stage. By designing a foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller, we kept the strongest part of the classical pedal design, while allowing the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance has been recorded and compared, and their opinion has been investigated through questionnaire and interview. The results of the experiment showed that, in theory, foot\&instrument-mounted effect controller can replace standard effect pedals and at the same time provide more mobility on a stage. },

  abstract =	 {This paper is a description of a pilot project conducted at the Hamburg University of Music and Drama (HfMT) during the academic year 2015-16. In this project we have addressed how interventions via interactive, generative music systems may contribute to the improvement of the atmosphere and thus to the well-being of patients in hospital waiting areas. The project was conducted by both the students of the music therapy and multimedia composition programs and has thus offered rare insights into the dynamic of such undertakings covering both the therapeutic underpinnings, as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular result.  DJster, the engine we used for the generative processes is based on Clarence Barlow&#8217;s probabilistic algorithms. Equipped with the proper periphery (sensors, sound modules and spatializers), we looked at three different scenarios, each requiring specific musical and technological solutions. The pilot was concluded by a symposium in 2017 and the development of a prototype system. The symposium yielded a diagram detailing the circular dynamic of the factors involved in this particular project, while the prototype was demoed in 2016 at the HfMT facilities. The system will be installed permanently at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in June 2017.},

  abstract =	 {The need for thorough evaluations is an emerging area of interest and importance in music interaction research. As a large degree of DMI evaluation is concerned with exploring the subjective experience: ergonomics, action-sound mappings and control intimacy; User Experience (UX) methods are increasingly being utilised to analyse an individual's experience of new musical instruments, from which we can extract meaningful, robust findings and subsequently generalised and useful recommendations. However, many music interaction evaluations remain informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014 -- 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to highlight methods from UX's widening field of research that have not yet been explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.},

  abstract =	 {The Fragment String is a new digital musical instrument designed to reinterpret and reflect upon the sounds of the instruments it is performed in collaboration with. At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural, tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment String to a variety of performance techniques and settings. These are explored through case studies in a five year history of Fragment String-based compositions and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations of these interactions and their sonic output.  },

The overall user experience offered by the technology can be described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram.  &#160; More specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the dynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together determine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of this visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides real-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved by the user.  Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a floating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly overlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are symbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up within a grid if the instance is providing output to the user.  &#160; We discuss the system's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications. This from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the uniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of new forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently presented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.},

However, not all provide applicable design suggestions, especially where subtle but important details are concerned. Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to explore how violin makers ``go beyond the obvious'', and how players perceive and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge, which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of ``sound and feeling'' are much more difficult to describe. In the DMI domain, we introduce NIMEcraft to describe subtle differences between otherwise identical instruments and their underlying design processes, and consider how to improve the dissemination of NIMEcraft.},

The string-plate model is formulated in a way that prioritises its parametric explorability. Where the roles of creating performance gestures and designing instruments are traditionally separated, such a design provides a continuum across these domains. The string-plate model, its real-time implementation, and the control interface are described, and the system is preliminarily evaluated through informal observations of how musicians engage with the system.},

In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability.  Examples drawn from our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for artistic creation and reusability.

NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology, engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies. Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing an alternative approach: musical organics .  Musical organics is a philosophical attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the Reactable.  This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical culture.},

  abstract =	 {This paper is about a novel robotic guitar that establishes shared control between human performers and mechanical actuators.  Unlike other mechatronic guitar instruments that perform pre-programmed music automatically, this guitar allows the human and actuators to produce sounds jointly; there exists a distributed control between the human and robotic components. The interaction allows human performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with a rhythmic pattern.  Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports real-time interactive improvising.},

The capabilities of the mutantrumpet are designed to erase the boundaries between acoustic and electronic musical creation and performance. It is both an expanded acoustic instrument and an electronic controller capable of interacting with audio and video simultaneously. The demonstration will explore the multi-faceted possibilities that are offered by the mutantrumpet in several brief, wide ranging musical examples composed and improvised by Neill.  Interactive video performance techniques and collaborations will be integrated into the excerpts. The aesthetics of live intermedia performance will be discussed along with a technical overview of the interface and associated software applications Junxion and RoSa from STEIM, Amsterdam.  Reflections on the development of a virtuosic performance technique with a hybrid instrument and influences from collaborators Robert Moog, David Behrman, Ralph Abraham, DJ Spooky and others will be included in the presentation.},

Mobile applications that streamline creativity and social interaction have enabled a very broad audience to develop their own creative practices. While these apps have been very successful in visual arts (particularly photography), the idea of social music-making has not had such a broad impact. MicroJam includes several novel performance concepts intended to engage the casual music maker and inspired by current trends in social creativity support tools. Touch-screen performances are limited to five seconds, instrument settings are posed as sonic ``filters'', and past performances are arranged as a timeline with replies and layers. These features of MicroJam encourage users not only to perform music more frequently, but to engage with others in impromptu ensemble music making.},

The body of the instrument emerged from material-led making, and the disparate elements of a particular musical performance ecology (acoustic instrument, audio effects, samples, synthesis and controls) are juxtaposed and unified into one coherent whole. As such, Kalimbo demonstrates how visual arts, in particular collage, can inform the design and creation of new musical instruments, interfaces and streamlined performance ecologies.},

We found that timbral and dynamic features related to the plucking hand were most important to the survey respondents. We designed an actuated fretting mechanism to replace the role of the fretting hand in order to preserve plucking hand techniques. We then conducted a performance study in which experienced bassists prepared and performed an accompaniment to a backing track with the adapted bass. The performances highlighted ways in which adapting a fretted string instrument in this way impacts plucking hand technique. },

The boxes could be used together with any instrument, or on their own &#8211; in this case they create a feedback loop by listening and responding to each other, creating ever-changing rhythmic structures.  Feedboxes react to incoming sounds in simple, predefined manner. Yet, when used together, their behaviour may become quite complex. Each of two boxes has its own sound and set of simple rules.},
