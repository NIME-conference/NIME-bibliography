  Abstract                 = {An interactive music instrument museum experience for children of 10-12 years is presented. Equipped with tablet devices, the children are sent on a treasure hunt. Based on given sound samples, the participants have to identify the right musical instrument (harpsichord, double bass, viola) out of an instrument collection. As the right instrument is located, a challenge of playing an application on the tablet is initiated. This application is an interactive digital representation of the found instrument, mimicking some of its key playing techniques, using a simplified scrolling on screen musical notation. The musical performance of the participant is graded on a point scale. After completion of the challenge, the participants' performances of the three instruments are played back simultaneously, constituting a composition. A qualitative evaluation of the application in a focus group interview with school children revealed that the children were more engaged when playing with the interactive application than when only watching a music video.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we describe the prototyping of two musical interfaces that use the LeapMotion camera in conjunction with two different touch surfaces: a Wacom tablet and a transparent PVC sheet. In the Wacom use case, the camera is between the hand and the surface. In the PVC use case, the camera is under the transparent sheet and tracks the hand through it. The aim of this research is to explore hovering motion surrounding the touch interaction on the surface and include properties of such motion in the musical interaction. We present our unifying software, called AirPiano, that discretises the 3D space into 'keys' and proposes several mapping strategies with the available dimensions. These control dimensions are mapped onto a modified HandSketch sound engine that achieves multitimbral pitch-synchronous point cloud granulation.},

Since the accuracy of previous audio-based transcription systems is not satisfactory, we propose an innovative visual-based automatic music transcription system named claVision to perform piano music transcription. Instead of processing the music audio, the system performs the transcription only from the video performance captured by a camera mounted over the piano keyboard. claVision can be used as a transcription tool, but it also has other applications such as music education. The claVision software has a very high accuracy (over 95%) and a very low latency in real-time music transcription, even under different illumination conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Many new melodic instruments use a touch sensitive surface with notes arranged in a two-dimensional grid. Most of these arrange notes in chromatic half-steps along the horizontal axis and in intervals of fourths along the vertical axis. Although many alternatives exist, this arrangement, which resembles that of a bass guitar, is quickly becoming the de facto standard. In this study we present experimental evidence that grid based instruments are significantly easier to play when we tune adjacent rows in Major thirds rather than fourths. We have developed a grid-based instrument as an iPad app that has sold 8,000 units since 2012. To test our proposed alternative tuning, we taught a group twenty new users to play basic chords on our app, using both the standard tuning and our proposed alternative. Our results show that the Major thirds tuning is much easier to learn, even for users that have previous experience playing guitar.},

In both cases, the design process is not focused on creating DMIs for a community with a particular culture - with established instruments, repertoire and playing styles - outside European and North American traditions. This challenge motivated our research. In this paper, we discuss lessons learned during an one-year project called Batebit. Our approach was based on Design Thinking methodology, comprising cycles of inspiration, ideation and implementation. It resulted in two new DMIs developed collaboratively with musicians from the Brazilian Northeast.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluation has been suggested to be one of the main trends in current NIME research. However, the meaning of the term for the community may not be as clear as it seems. In order to explore this issue, we have analyzed all papers and posters published in the proceedings of the NIME conference from 2012 to 2014. For each publication that explicitly mentioned the term evaluation, we looked for: a) What targets and stakeholders were considered? b) What goals were set? c) What criteria were used? d) What methods were used? e) How long did the evaluation last? Results show different understandings of evaluation, with little consistency regarding the usage of the word. Surprisingly in some cases, not even basic information such as goal, criteria and methods were provided. In this paper, we attempt to provide an idea of what evaluation means for the NIME community, pushing the discussion towards how could we make a better use of evaluation on NIME design and what criteria should be used regarding each goal.},

Typically, identifying distinct samples of a song requires expertise in music production software. Additionally, it is difficult to visualize similarities and differences between all samples of a song simultaneously and use this to select samples. MusicMapper is a web application that allows nonexpert users to find and visualize distinctive samples from a song without any manual intervention, and enables remixing by having users play back clusterings of such samples. This is accomplished by splitting audio from the Soundcloud API into appropriately-sized spectrograms, and applying the t-SNE algorithm to visualize these spectrograms in two dimensions. Next, we apply k-means to guide the user's eye toward related clusters and set $k=26$ to enable playback of the clusters by pressing keys on an ordinary keyboard. We present the source code (https://github.com/fatsmcgee/MusicMappr) and a demo video (http://youtu.be/mvD6e1uiO8k) of the MusicMapper web application that can be run in most modern browsers.},

  Abstract                 = {Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians influence the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality. More specifically, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We suggest that the perceived causality between a performer's gestures and the musical result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of an experimental study investigating the effect of visual augmentations on audience's inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of performances with DMIs impacts the audience's causal inferences about the performer. In particular we show that visual augmentations help highlight the influence of the musician when parts of the music are automated, and help clarify complex mappings between gestures and sounds. Finally we discuss the potential wider implications for assessing liveness in the design of new musical interfaces.},

It relies on spectators and performers revealing virtual objects by slicing through them with body parts or objects, and on planar slightly reflective transparent panels that combine the stage and audience spaces. In this paper, we describe the approach and implementation challenges of Reflets. We then demonstrate that it matches the requirements of musical performances. It allows for placing virtual content anywhere on large stages, even overlapping with physical elements and provides a consistent rendering of this content for large numbers of spectators. It also preserves non-verbal communication between the audience and the performers, and is inherently engaging for the spectators. We finally show that Reflets opens musical performance opportunities such as augmented interaction between musicians and novel techniques for 3D sound shapes manipulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Biofeedback tools generally use visualizations to display physiological information to the user. As such, these tools are incompatible with visually demanding tasks such as driving. While auditory or haptic biofeedback may be used in these cases, the additional sensory channels can increase workload or act as a nuisance to the user. A number of studies, however, have shown that music can improve mood and concentration, while also reduce aggression and boredom. Here, we propose an intervention that combines the benefits of biofeedback and music to help users regulate their stress response while performing a visual task (driving a car simulator). Our approach encourages slow breathing by adjusting the quality of the music in response to the user's breathing rate. We evaluate the intervention on a 2$\times$2 design with music and auditory biofeedback as independent variables. Our results indicate that our music-biofeedback intervention leads to lower arousal (reduced electrodermal activity and increased heart rate variability) than music alone, auditory biofeedback alone and a control condition. },

We used scientific research as a starting point to create a means of sound production and resonator, using a 3D model obtained from Computed Topology (CT) scans of a Corythosaurus skull and an endocast of its crest and nasal passages. Users give voice to the dinosaur by blowing into a mouthpiece, exciting a larynx mechanism and resonating the sound through the hadrosaur's full-scale nasal cavities and skull. This action allows an embodied glimpse into an ancient past. Users know the dinosaur through the controlled exhalation of their breath, how the compression of the lungs leads to a whisper or a roar.},

At least 4 sensors are required: 2 for the front and 2 for the back; this prototype uses 6. The sensors are rather inexpensive, widening the economic availability. For each individual musician, the algorithms are capable of ``per- sonalising'' postures in order to create consistent evaluations; the results of which may be, but are not limited to: new musical interfaces, educational analysis of technique, or music controllers. In building a prototype for the algorithms, data was acquired by wiring the sensors to a data-logger. The algorithms and tests were implemented using MATLAB. After designing the algorithms, various tests were run in order to prove their reliability. These determined that indeed the algorithms work to a sufficient degree of certainty, allowing for a reliable classification of a musician's posture or position.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on a combination of novel mapping techniques and carefully designed sound engines, I present an augmented hybrid piano specifically designed for improvisation. The mapping technique, originally developed for other control interfaces but here adapted to the piano keyboard, is based on a dynamic vectorization of control parameters, allowing both wild sonic exploration and minute intimate expression. The original piano sound is used as the sole sound source, subjected to processing techniques such as virtual resonance strings, dynamic buffer shuffling, and acoustic and virtual feedback. Thanks to speaker and microphone placement, the acoustic and processed sounds interact in both directions and blend into one new instrument. This also allows for unorthodox playing (knocking, plucking, shouting). Processing parameters are controlled from the keyboard playing alone, allowing intuitive control of complex processing by ear, integrating expressive musical playing with sonic exploration. The instrument is not random, but somewhat unpredictable. This feeds into the improvisation, defining a particular idiomatics of the instruments. Hence, the instrument itself is an essential part of the musical work. Performances include concerts in UK, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Sweden, in solos and ensembles, performed by several pianists. Variations of this hybrid instrument for digital keyboards are also presented.},

Based on these changes, the pipe determines when the user per- forms a puff, double-puff, sip, double-sip or a long puff or long sip action, and wirelessly sends commands to a smart- phone running the music player. Additionally, the Perip- ipe provides fumeovisual feedback, using color-illuminated smoke to display the system status. With the form fac- tor, the materials used, the interaction through breath, and the ephemeral feedback we aim to emphasize the emotional component of listening to music that, in our eyes, is not very well reflected in traditional remote controls.},

Doppelg{\"a}nger transfers one soundscape into another using audio analysis, mapping, and computer-controlled acoustic sound objects. The technical realization is based on hammer mechanisms actuated by powerful solenoids, driven by a network of Arduino boards with high power PWM outputs, and a Max-patch running audio analysis and mapping. We look into the special requirements in mechanics for large-scale projects. Great care has been taken in the technical design to ensure that the resulting work is scalable both in numbers of elements and in physical dimensions.

They can also run full Linux operating systems, through which domain-specific languages for audio computing facilitate a low entry barrier for the community. In computer music the adoption of these computing platforms will naturally depend on their ability to withstand the demanding computing tasks associated to high-quality audio synthesis. In the context of computer music practice there are few reports about this quantification for practical purposes.

  Abstract                 = {This study compares the stage metaphor and the channel strip metaphor in terms of performance. Traditionally, music mixing consoles employ a channels strip control metaphor for adjusting parameters such as volume and panning of each track. An alternative control metaphor, the so-called stage metaphor lets the user adjust volume and panning by positioning tracks relative to a virtual listening position. In this study test participants are given the task to adjust volume and panning of one channel (in mixes consisting of three channels) in order to replicate a series of simple pre-rendered mixes. They do this using (1) a small physical mixing controller and (2) using an iPad app, which implements a simple stage metaphor interface. We measure how accurately they are able to replicate mixes in terms of volume and panning and how fast they are at doing so. Results reveal that performance is surprisingly similar and thus we are not able to detect any significant difference in performance between the two interfaces. Qualitative data however, suggests that the stage metaphor is largely favoured for its intuitive interaction - confirming earlier studies. },

The use of embodied metaphors within these mappings is seen as a means of managing the complexity of a musical performance across multiple modalities. In particular, we will investigate how these mapping strategies may facilitate the creation of performance systems whose accessibility and richness are enhanced by common integrating bases. A key focus for this work is the investigation of the embodied image schema theories of Lakoff and Johnson alongside similarly embodied metaphorical models within Smalley's influential theory of electroacoustic music (spectromorphology). These metaphors will be investigated for their use as grounding structural components and dynamics for creative practices and musical interaction design. We argue that pairing metaphorical models of forces with environmental forms may have particular significance for the design of complex mappings for digital music performance.},

Inherent subjectivity in these assessments is inevitable, yet the recognition of performance attributes by which humans perceive quality has wide applicability to related tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR) community and jazz pedagogy.

  Abstract                 = {Live music making can be understood as an enactive process, whereby musical experiences are created through human action. This suggests that musical worlds coevolve with their agents through repeated sensorimotor interactions with the environment (where the music is being created), and at the same time cannot be separated from their sociocultural contexts. This paper investigates this claim by exploring ways in which technology, physiology, and context are bound up within two different musical scenarios: live electronic musical performance; and person-centred arts applications of NIMEs. In this paper I outline an ethnographic and phenomenological enquiry into my experiences as both a performer of live electronic and electro-instrumental music, as well as my extensive background in working with new technologies in various therapeutic and person-centred artistic situations. This is in order to explore the sociocultural and technological contexts in which these activities take place. I propose that by understanding creative musical participation as a highly contextualised practice, we may discover that the greatest impact of rapidly developing technological resources is their ability to afford richly diverse, personalised, and embodied forms of music making. I argue that this is applicable over a wide range of musical communities.},

  Abstract                 = {The Hayward Tuning Vine is a software interface for exploring the system of microtonal tuning known as Just Intonation. Based ultimately on prime number relationships, harmonic space in Just Intonation is inherently multidimensional, with each prime number tracing a unique path in space. Taking this multidimensionality as its point of departure, the Tuning Vine interface assigns a unique angle and colour to each prime number, along with aligning melodic pitch height to vertical height on the computer screen. These features allow direct and intuitive interaction with Just Intonation. The inclusion of a transposition function along each prime number axis also enables potentially unlimited exploration of harmonic space within prime limit 23. Currently available as desktop software, a prototype for a hardware version has also been constructed, and future tablet app and hardware versions of the Tuning Vine are planned that will allow tangible as well as audiovisual interaction with microtonal harmonic space.},

  Abstract                 = {Locative music experiences are often non-linear and as such they are co-created, as the final arrangement of the music heard is guided by the movements of the user. We note an absence of principles and guidelines regarding how composers should approach the structuring of such locative soundtracks. For instance, how does one compose for a non-linear, indeterminate experience using linear pre-composed placed sounds, where fixed musical time is situated into the indeterminate time of the user's experience? Furthermore, how does one create a soundtrack that is suitable for the location, but also functions as a coherent musical structure? We explore these questions by analyzing an existing `placed sound' work from a traditional music theory perspective and in doing so reveal some structural principals from `fixed' musical forms can also support the composition of contemporary locative music experiences.},

  Abstract                 = { Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s of virtual machines which we propose to call a `cloud-orchestra'. Cloud computing allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills. This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music, and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation. The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize, deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up to the modelling software to optimize.},

The WamBam has unique possibilities to deal with the low motor skills and cognitive abilities of severely intellectually disabled users while music therapists benefit from the greater versatility and portability of this design compared to other musical instruments. A prototype was tested with twenty users. Participants proved to be triggered positively by the WamBam, but three limiting usability issues were found.

  Abstract                 = {The Internet holds a lot of potential as a music listening, collaboration, and performance space. It has become commonplace to stream music and video of musical performance over the web. However, the goal of playing rhythmically synchronized music over long distances has remained elusive due to the latency inherent in networked communication. The farther apart two artists are from one another, the greater the delay. Furthermore, latency times can change abruptly with no warning. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a distributed, synchronized musical instrument that allows performers to play together over long distances, despite latency. We describe one such instrument, MalLo, which combats latency by predicting a musician's action before it is completed. MalLo sends information about a predicted musical note over the Internet before it is played, and synthesizes this note at a collaborator's location at nearly the same moment it is played by the performer. MalLo also protects against latency spikes by sending the prediction data across multiple network paths, with the intention of routing around latency. },

An open-source software MIDI remapper called ChordEase was developed that dynamically alters the pitch of notes, in order to fit them to the chord scales of a predetermined song. ChordEase modifies the behavior of ordinary MIDI instruments, giving them new interfaces that permit non-modal music to be approached as if it were modal. Multiple instruments can be remapped simultaneously, using a variety of mapping functions, each optimized for a particular musical role. Harmonization and orchestration can also be automated. By facilitating the selection of scale tones, ChordEase enables performers to focus on other aspects of improvisation, and thus creates new possibilities for musical expression.},

Most importantly, there should be more amusing and engaging interaction between a tuning trainer and a user which is able to exchange roles of tuner and player. In this research, we implement an open-source program named ``Harmonic Intonation Trainer'' in Pure Data. It includes most of essential elements of a smart tuner. A user can tune his pitch while optionally hearing (through earphones) the target pitch and other harmonic intervals in respective octaves. Moreover, in its interactive accompanist mode, a user's input pitch serves as the reference frequency; the program follows his intonation to generate corresponding harmonic intervals. Additionally, user can straightforwardly edit all parameters and patches by Pure Data. Any adoption or revision is absolutely welcome. Finally, we will initiate another research to test and to inspect experimental results from student orchestras so that its future version is expected to be more sophisticated.},

The degree to which the sampled control signal is processed during replay is adjustable in real-time by the manipulation of a continuous finger slider function. The reshaping algorithm uses stochastic methods commonly used for MIDI note generation from a provided dataset. The reshaped signal therefore varies in an unpredictable manner. In this way the Gestroviser is a device to capture, reshape and replay an instrumental gesture.

Thus, in the case of the Wave Duet, the produced buoys were prompted by investigating the relationship between sonic objects and natural phenomena. As a result, the mappings, physical and sound designs directly reflect these issues. Finally, it is also suggested that during the course of development, unintended issues may emerge and further inform how the work is perceived in a broader sense. },

  Abstract                 = {Inclusive music activities for people with physical disabilities commonly emphasise facilitated processes, based both on constrained gestural capabilities, and on the simplicity of the available interfaces. Inclusive music processes employ consumer controllers, computer access tools and/or specialized digital musical instruments (DMIs). The first category reveals a design ethos identified by the authors as artefact multiplication -- many sliders, buttons, dials and menu layers; the latter types offer ergonomic accessibility through artefact magnification. We present a prototype DMI that eschews artefact multiplication in pursuit of enhanced real time creative independence. We reconceptualise the universal click-drag interaction model via a single sensor type, which affords both binary and continuous performance control. Accessibility is optimized via a familiar interaction model and through customized ergonomics, but it is the mapping strategy that emphasizes transparency and sophistication in the hierarchical correspondences between the available gesture dimensions and expressive musical cues. Through a participatory and progressive methodology we identify an ostensibly simple targeting gesture rich in dynamic and reliable features: (1) contact location; (2) contact duration; (3) momentary force; (4) continuous force, and; (5) dyad orientation. These features are mapped onto dynamic musical cues, most notably via new mappings for vibrato and arpeggio execution. },

Even when the relationship between action and sound is readily understandable, the internal hardware or software operations that create that relationship may be inaccessible to scrutiny or modification. This paper presents a new approach to digital instrument design which lets the performer alter and subvert the instrument's internal operation through circuit-bending techniques. The approach uses low-latency feedback loops between software and analog hardware to expose the internal working of the instrument. Compared to the standard control voltage approach used on analog synths, alterations to the feedback loops produce distinctive and less predictable changes in behaviour with original artistic applications. This paper discusses the technical foundations of the approach, its roots in hacking and circuit bending, and case studies of its use in live performance with the D-Box hackable instrument.},

Inspired by the Tonnetz (a tonal diagram), we present a new layout of pitches defined using low-level harmonic notions. We demonstrate the potential of our system by mapping the random movements of fish in an aquarium to this layout. Qualitatively, we find that this captures the intuition behind mapping motion to sound. Similarly moving fish produce consonant chords, while fish moving in non-unison produce dissonant chords. We introduce an open source MATLAB library implementing these techniques, which can be used for sonifying multimodal streaming data. },

Caress is an octophonic miniature drum-set for the fingertips that employs eight acoustically isolated piezo-microphones, coupled with eight independent signal chains that excite a unique resonance model with audio from the piezos. The hardware is designed to be robust and quickly reproducible (parametric design and machine fabrication), while the software aims to be light-weight (low-CPU requirements) and portable (multiple platforms, multiple computing architectures). Above all, the instrument aims for the level of control intimacy and tactile expressivity achieved by traditional acoustic percussive instruments, while leveraging real-time software synthesis and control to expand the sonic palette. This instrument as well as this document are dedicated to the memory of the late David Wessel, pioneering composer, performer, researcher, mentor and all-around Yoda of electroacoustic music. },

VESBALL has an advantage over other related work in terms of its robustness, ease of operation and setup (for clients and therapists), sound source integration, and low cost of production.

To achieve the gesture localization we use a novel approach combining attack parametrization and template matching across the two microphone channels. With this method we can correctly localize 80 $\pm$ 9 % of the percussive gestures. The user can assign determined pitches to specific positions and change the pitch palette in real time. The tactile feedback characteristic of every surface opens a set of new playing strategies and possibilities specific to any chosen object. The advantages of such a system are the affordable production, flexibility of concert location, object-specific musical instruments, portability, and easy setup.},

It combines the ability for building location- based audio walks and -guides with the components necessary for game development.

This investigation looks at how machine learning algorithms fit generative purposes and what independent behaviours they enable.

Fields not only offers a new technological approach to sound diffusion, it also provides an alternative way for audiences to participate in live events, and opens up unique forms of engagement within sonic media contexts. },

The system also provides a novel approach to the use of generative techniques in the composition and live performance of songs.

However, most current systems lack basic musicianship skills. As a consequence, the results of human-computer interaction are often far less musical than the interaction between human musicians. In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist, learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size, and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel user interface that enables control of a singing voice synthesizer at a live improvisational performance. The user first registers the lyrics of a song with the system before performance, and the system builds a probabilistic model that models the possible jumps within the lyrics. During performance, the user simultaneously inputs the lyrics of a song with the left hand using a vowel keyboard and the melodies with the right hand using a standard musical keyboard. Our system searches for a portion of the registered lyrics whose vowel sequence matches the current user input using the probabilistic model, and sends the matched lyrics to the singing voice synthesizer. The vowel input keys are mapped onto a standard musical keyboard, enabling experienced keyboard players to learn the system from a standard musical score. We examine the feasibility of the system through a series of evaluations and user studies. },

  Abstract                 = {Multi-touch mobile devices provide a fresh paradigm for interactions, as well as a platform for building rich musical applications. This paper presents a multi-touch mobile programming environment that supports the exploration of different representations in visual programming for music and audio interfaces. Using a common flow-based visual programming vocabulary, we implemented a system based on the urMus platform that explores three types of touch-based interaction representations: a text-based menu representation, a graphical icon-based representation, and a novel multi-touch gesture-based representation. We illustrated their use on interface design for musical controllers.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) integrated with a musical instrument that adapts implicitly (with no extra effort from user) to users' changing cognitive state during musical improvisation. Most previous musical BCI systems use either a mapping of brainwaves to create audio signals or use explicit brain signals to control some aspect of the music. Such systems do not take advantage of higher level semantically meaningful brain data which could be used in adaptive systems or without detracting from the attention of the user. We present a new type of real-time BCI that assists users in musical improvisation by adapting to users' measured cognitive workload implicitly. Our system advances the state of the art in this area in three ways: 1) We demonstrate that cognitive workload can be classified in real-time while users play the piano using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. 2) We build a real-time, implicit system using this brain signal that musically adapts to what users are playing. 3) We demonstrate that users prefer this novel musical instrument over other conditions and report that they feel more creative.},
